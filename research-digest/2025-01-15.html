                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.Sequential decision-making, where choices are made one after the other, is an important aspect of our daily lives. For example, when searching for a job, an apartment, or deciding when to buy or sell a stock, people often have to make decisions without knowing what future opportunities might arise. These situations, which are known as optimal stopping problems, involve a risk associated with the decision to either stop or continue searching. However, previous research has not consistently found a clear connection between individuals’ search behavior in these tasks and their risk preferences as measured in controlled experimental settings. In this paper, we explore how particular characteristics of optimal stopping tasks affect people&#39;s choices, extending beyond their stable risk preferences. We find that (1) the way the underlying sampling distribution is presented (whether it is based on experience or description), (2) the sequential presentation of options, and (3) the unequal frequencies of choices to reject versus to accept significantly bias people choices. These results shed light on the complex nature of decisions that unfold sequentially and emphasize the importance of incorporating context factors when studying human decision behavior.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsBayesianism, that is, the formal capturing of belief in terms of probabilities, has had a major impact in cognitive science. Decades of research have examined lay reasoners’ learning and reasoning with probabilities. The bulk of that research has concerned the response to new evidence. That response will depend on the conditional probabilities a reasoner assumes, yet little research has addressed the question of how reasoners respond when they are provided with new conditional probabilities. Furthermore, there are not just open empirical questions as to how lay reasoners actually respond, there are also open questions about how they should respond. This is illustrated by philosophical debate about the so-called Judy Benjamin Problem. In this paper, we present experiments on belief revision problems in which the new information is a conditional probability. More specifically, we investigate two versions of these problems. One where basic probability theory (as the core of what it means ‘to be Bayesian’) provides a single correct answer, and one where that answer is under-constrained. The former provide a new type of evidence on the longstanding question of human probabilistic reasoning skill. The latter informs debate on how to expand the Bayesian toolbox to deal with the issues raised by the Judy Benjamin Problem.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsLearning structures that effectively abstract decision policies is key to the flexibility of human intelligence. Previous work has shown that humans use hierarchically structured policies to efficiently navigate complex and dynamic environments. However, the computational processes that support the learning and construction of such policies remain insufficiently understood. To address this question, we tested 1026 human participants, who made over 1 million choices combined, in a decision-making task where they could learn, transfer, and recompose multiple sets of hierarchical policies. We propose a novel algorithmic account for the learning processes underlying observed human behavior. We show that humans rely on compressed policies over states in early learning, which gradually unfold into hierarchical representations via meta-learning and Bayesian inference. Our modeling evidence suggests that these hierarchical policies are structured in a temporally backward, rather than forward, fashion. Taken together, these algorithmic architectures characterize how the interplay between reinforcement learning, policy compression, meta-learning, and working memory supports structured decision-making and compositionality in a resource-rational way.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.How are people able to understand everyday physical events with such ease? One hypothesis suggests people use an approximate probabilistic simulation of the world. A contrasting hypothesis is that people use a collection of abstractions or features. While it has been noted that the two hypotheses explain complementary aspects of physical reasoning, there has yet to be a model of how these two modes of reasoning can be used together. We develop a “blended model” that synthesizes the two hypotheses: under certain conditions, simulation is replaced by a visuo-spatial abstraction (linear path projection). This abstraction purchases efficiency at the cost of fidelity, and the blended model predicts that people will make systematic errors whenever the conditions for applying the abstraction are met. We tested this prediction in two experiments where participants made judgments about whether a falling ball will contact a target. First, we show that response times are longer when straight-line paths are unavailable, even when simulation time is held fixed, arguing against a pure-simulation model (Experiment 1). Second, we show that people incorrectly judge the trajectory of the ball in a manner consistent with linear path projection (Experiment 2). We conclude that people have access to a flexible mental physics engine, but adaptively invoke more efficient abstractions when they are useful.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsInfants explore the world around them based on their intrinsically motivated curiosity. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying such curiosity-driven exploratory behaviour remain largely unknown. Here, infants could freely explore two novel categories, triggering a new exemplar from a category by fixating on either of the two associated areas on a computer screen. This gaze-contingent design enabled us to distinguish between exploration – switching from one category to another – and exploitation – consecutively triggering exemplars from the same category. Data from 10 to 12-month-old infants (N = 68) indicated that moment-to-moment sampling choices were non-random but guided by the infants&#39; exploration history. Self-generated sequences grouped into three clusters of brief yet explorative, longer exploitative, and overall more balanced sampling patterns. Bayesian hierarchical binomial regression models indicated that across sequence patterns, infants&#39; longer trigger time, shorter looking time, and more gaze-shifting were associated with trial-by-trial decisions to disengage from exploiting one category and making an exploratory switch, especially after consecutively viewed stimuli of high similarity. These findings offer novel insights into infants&#39; curiosity-driven exploration and pave the way for future investigations, also regarding individual differences.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsAction allows us to shape the world around us. But to act effectively we need to accurately sense what we can and cannot control. Classic theories across cognitive science suppose that this ‘sense of agency’ is constructed from the sensorimotor signals we experience as we interact with our surroundings. But these sensorimotor signals are inherently ambiguous, and can provide us with a distorted picture of what we can and cannot influence. Here we investigate one way that agents like us might overcome the inherent ambiguity of these signals: by combining noisy sensorimotor evidence with prior beliefs about control acquired through explicit communication with others. Using novel tools to measure and model control decisions, we find that explicit beliefs about the controllability of the environment alter both the sensitivity and bias of agentic choices; meaning that we are both better at detecting and more biased to feel control when we are told to expect it. These seemingly paradoxical effects on agentic choices can be captured by a computational model where expecting to be in control exaggerates the sensitivity or ‘gain’ of the mechanisms we use to detect our influence over our surroundings – making us increasingly sensitised to both true and illusory signs of agency. In combination, these results reveal a cognitive and computational mechanism that allows public communication about what we can and cannot influence to reshape our private sense of control.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.It is well known that people will exert effort on a task if sufficiently motivated, but how they distribute these efforts across different strategies (e.g., efficiency vs. caution) remains uncertain. Past work has shown that people invest effort differently for potential positive outcomes (rewards) versus potential negative outcomes (penalties). However, this research failed to account for differences in the context in which negative outcomes motivate someone - either as punishment or reinforcement. It is therefore unclear whether effort profiles differ as a function of outcome valence, motivational context, or both. Using computational modeling and our novel Multi-Incentive Control Task, we show that the influence of aversive outcomes on one&#39;s effort profile is entirely determined by their motivational context. Participants (N:91) favored increased caution in response to larger penalties for incorrect responses, and favored increased efficiency in response to larger reinforcement for correct responses, whether positively or negatively incentivized. Statement of relevance: People have to constantly decide how to allocate their mental effort, and in doing so can be motivated by both the positive outcomes that effort accrues and the negative outcomes that effort avoids. For example, someone might persist on a project for work in the hopes of being promoted or to avoid being reprimanded or even fired. Understanding how people weigh these different types of incentives is critical for understanding variability in human achievement as well as sources of motivational impairments (e.g., in major depression). We show that people not only consider both potential positive and negative outcomes when allocating mental effort, but that the profile of effort they engage under negative incentives differs depending on whether that outcome is contingent on sustaining good performance (negative reinforcement) or avoiding bad performance (punishment). Clarifying the motivational factors that determine effort exertion is an important step for understanding motivational impairments in psychopathology.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024The growing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in our lives has brought the impact of AI-based decisions on human judgments to the forefront of academic scholarship and public debate. Despite growth in research on people&#39;s receptivity towards AI, little is known about how interacting with AI shapes subsequent interactions among people. We explore this question in the context of unfair decisions determined by AI versus humans and focus on the spillover effects of experiencing such decisions on the propensity to act prosocially. Four experiments (combined N = 2425) show that receiving an unfair allocation by an AI (versus a human) actor leads to lower rates of prosocial behavior towards other humans in a subsequent decision—an effect we term AI-induced indifference. In Experiment 1, after receiving an unfair monetary allocation by an AI (versus a human) actor, people were less likely to act prosocially, defined as punishing an unfair human actor at a personal cost in a subsequent, unrelated decision. Experiments 2a and 2b provide evidence for the underlying mechanism: People blame AI actors less than their human counterparts for unfair behavior, decreasing people&#39;s desire to subsequently sanction injustice by punishing the unfair actor. In an incentive-compatible design, Experiment 3 shows that AI-induced indifference manifests even when the initial unfair decision and subsequent interaction occur in different contexts. These findings illustrate the spillover effect of human-AI interaction on human-to-human interactions and suggest that interacting with unfair AI may desensitize people to the bad behavior of others, reducing their likelihood to act prosocially. Implications for future research are discussed.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.While the visual world is rich and complex, importantly, it nevertheless contains many statistical regularities. For example, environmental feature distributions tend to remain relatively stable from one moment to the next. Recent findings have shown how observers can learn surprising details of environmental color distributions, even when the colors belong to actively ignored stimuli such as distractors in visual search. Our aim was to determine whether such learning influences orienting in the visual environment, measured with saccadic eye movements. In two visual search experiments, observers had to find an odd-one-out target. Firstly, we tested cases where observers selected targets by fixating them. Secondly, we measured saccadic eye movements when observers made judgments on the target and responded manually. Trials were structured in blocks, containing learning trials where distractors came from the same color distribution (uniform or Gaussian) while on subsequent test trials, the target was at different distances from the mean of the learning distractor distribution. For both manual and saccadic measures, performance improved throughout the learning trials and was better when the distractor colors came from a Gaussian distribution. Moreover, saccade latencies during test trials depended on the distance between the color of the current target and the distractors on learning trials, replicating results obtained with manual responses. Latencies were slowed when the target color was within the learning distractor color distribution and also revealed that observers learned the difference between uniform and Gaussian distributions. The importance of several variables in predicting saccadic and manual reaction times was studied using random forests, revealing similar rankings for both modalities, although previous distractor color had a higher impact on free eye movements. Overall, our results demonstrate learning of detailed characteristics of environmental color distributions that affects early attentional selection rather than later decisional processes.</span>

Using a unique brokerage dataset and a series of experiments, we compare people&#39;s initial risk-taking plans to their subsequent decisions. Across settings, people accept risk as part of a loss-exit strategy—planning to continue taking risk after gains and stopping after losses. Actual behavior deviates from initial strategies by cutting gains early and chasing losses. More people accept risk when offered a commitment to their initial strategy. Our results help reconcile seemingly contradictory findings on risk-taking in static versus dynamic contexts. We explore implications for theory and welfare. (JEL D81, G13, G24, G41)</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsSome seemingly irrational decision behaviors (anomalies), once seen as flaws in human cognition, have recently received explanations from a rational perspective. The basic idea is that the brain has limited cognitive resources to process the quantities (e.g., value, probability, time, etc.) required for decision making, with specific biases arising as byproducts of the resource allocation that is optimized for the environment. While appealing for providing normative accounts, the existing resource-rational models have limitations such as inconsistent assumptions across models, a focus on optimization for one specific aspect of the environment, and limited coverage of decision anomalies. One challenging anomaly is the peanuts effect, a pervasive phenomenon in decision-making under risk that implies an interdependence between the processing of value and probability. To extend the resource rationality approach to explain the peanuts effect, here we develop a computational framework—the Assemblable Resource-Rational Modules (ARRM)—that integrates ideas from different lines of boundedly-rational decision models as freely assembled modules. The framework can accommodate the joint functioning of multiple environmental factors, and allow new models to be built and tested along with the existing ones, potentially opening a wider range of decision phenomena to bounded rationality modeling. For one new and three published datasets that cover two different task paradigms and both the gain and loss domains, our boundedly-rational models reproduce two characteristic features of the peanuts effect and outperform previous models in fitting human decision behaviors.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT This study examined economic risk preferences using a multidimensional approach in adolescents and young adults ( N = 444, ages 13–27). Despite the two major theoretical approaches in adolescent economic risk‐taking—socioemotional theories and fuzzy‐trace theory—comparatively little is known about the role of incidental affective factors in economic risk‐taking. We tested six demographic and psychological determinants (age, gender, positive/negative affect, state anxiety, and indecision) on two economic risk decision tasks (loss aversion and skewness). Adolescents reported higher positive affect and lower negative affect than adults, but anxiety and indecision were age‐invariant. Women showed lower positive affect and higher negative affect, state anxiety, and indecision compared to men. We found women to be more loss‐averse; all other factors were not related to loss aversion. Adolescents were equally likely to accept symmetric and skewed gambles, whereas adults had more nuanced preferences. Adolescents also demonstrated a reduced bias toward negatively skewed risks compared to young adults, but both groups showed similar preferences for positively skewed and symmetric risks. These results support fuzzy‐trace theory&#39;s prediction of age‐related shifts from verbatim to gist representations: More verbatim processing during adolescence facilitated risk‐taking in negatively skewed risks, diverging from prospect theory. Positive affect shifted risk preference for adolescents and young adults in divergent directions—adolescents favored symmetrical risks more, while adults favored negatively skewed risks more. These patterns illustrate that adolescents and young adults in positive moods demonstrate risk preferences that are rare for their developmental stage, with potentially detrimental consequences depending on the choice at hand.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Ratios are an instrumental component of the communication of probabilities such as COVID incidence rates, side effects of medical drugs, or political decision‐making; hence, they are a critical component of an individual&#39;s statistical decision‐making. Research on the ratio bias has shown inconsistent results based on six major shortcomings which we surmount by replicating an identical experiment with students in Germany, Turkey, and Italy, with a physical , textual, and graphical depiction, and accounting for different levels of exposure to probabilities. In six studies ( N = 1338), we show that lower exposure to probabilities leads to significantly more ratio bias–conform choices. The results also suggest that higher levels of statistical numeracy and risk literacy reduce ratio bias–conform choices. Our contribution helps to better understand the ratio bias concerning different populations and highlights different baselines for ratio bias–conform choices among subgroups in the population.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract There is a large literature evaluating the dual process model of cognition, including the biases and heuristics it implies. However, our understanding of what causes effortful thinking remains incomplete. To advance this literature, we focus on what triggers decision-makers to switch from the intuitive process (System 1) to the more deliberative process (System 2). We examine how the framing of incentives (gains versus losses) influences decision processing. To evaluate this, we design experiments based on a task developed to distinguish between intuitive and deliberative thinking. Replicating previous research, we find that losses elicit more cognitive effort. Most importantly, we also find that losses differentially reduce the incidence of intuitive answers, consistent with triggering a shift between these modes of cognition. We find substantial heterogeneity in these effects, with young men being much more responsive to the loss framing. To complement these findings, we provide robustness tests of our results using aggregated data, the imposition of a constraint to hinder the activation of System 2, and an analysis of incorrect, but unintuitive, answers to inform hybrid models of choice.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract While most research on time preference has focused on gains, understanding time preference for losses is also crucial in practice. Some studies have shown that people prefer to bear a loss earlier rather than later, suggesting negative delay discounting. Nonetheless, most previous research either disallowed an exhibition of negative discounting or analyzed data suggesting opposite directions of discounting together. Furthermore, such research tended to draw conclusions based on aggregate data, although individual behavioral patterns could differ starkly from aggregate ones. To improve knowledge on individual time preference for losses, we conducted 3 experiments examining how systematically changing attribute values affected such preference. Using a choice method with delayed losses, Experiment 1 revealed 3 behavioral effects (i.e., the magnitude, common difference, and delay duration effects) at the aggregate level. For each effect, opposite changes in discount rate were found in data suggesting positive versus negative discounting. Similar results emerged in Experiment 2 using a matching task with delayed losses. Experiment 3 adopted a special form of the matching paradigm, where the amount of an immediate loss should be filled (i.e., an evaluation method). Distinct influences of loss amount were again found under opposite directions of delay discounting. Additionally, a reverse magnitude effect was found more often in Experiment 3 than the other experiments under positive discounting, illustrating the distinctiveness of the evaluation method. Finally, individual analyses revealed more diverse behavioral patterns than aggregate analyses in each study. This underscored the importance of understanding time preference for losses based on individual data.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract People often probability match: they select choices based on the probability of outcomes. For example, when predicting 10 individual results of a spinner with 7 green and 3 purple sections, many people choose green mostly but not always, even though they would be better off always choosing it (i.e., maximizing). This behavior has perplexed cognitive scientists for decades. Why do people make such an obvious error? Here, we provide evidence that this difficulty may often arise from statistical naïveté: Even when shown the optimal strategy of maximizing, many people fail to recognize that it will produce better payouts than other strategies. In 3 preregistered experiments ( N = 907 Americans tested online), participants made 10 choices in a spinner game and estimated the payout for each of 3 strategies: probability matching, maximizing, and 50/50 guessing. The key finding across experiments is that while most maximizers recognize that maximizing results in higher payouts than matching, probability matchers predict similar payouts for each .</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract First-order stochastic dominance is a core principle in rational decision-making. If lottery A has a higher or equal chance of winning an amount $x $ or more compared to lottery B for all x , and a strictly higher chance for at least one $x $ , then A should be preferred over B . Previous research suggests that violations of this principle may result from failures in recognizing coalescing equivalence. In Expected Utility Theory (EUT) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), gambles are represented as probability distributions, where probabilities of equivalent events can be combined, ensuring stochastic dominance. In contrast, the Transfer of Attention Exchange (TAX) model represents gambles as trees with branches for each probability and outcome, making it possible for coalescing and stochastic dominance violations to occur. We conducted two experiments designed to train participants in identifying dominance by splitting coalesced gambles. By toggling between displays of coalesced and split forms of the same choice problem, participants were instructed to recognize stochastic dominance. Despite this training, violations of stochastic dominance were only minimally reduced, as if people find it difficult—or even resist—shifting from a trees-with-branches representation (as in the TAX model) to a cognitive recognition of the equivalence among different representations of the same choice problem.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Effort is a ubiquitous feature in the decision-making literature. Increasing numbers of studies examine the effect of effort requirements on behavior using a discounting framework, assessing the process by which the subjective value of an outcome decreases as the effort required to obtain it increases. Therefore, a review of methodological approaches, findings, and issues is timely. Accordingly, in this systematic review, we identified research studies examining effort discounting to explore how choice architecture factors used in delay discounting and other experimental manipulations affected effort discounting, and the mathematical descriptors used to summarize the relationship between subjective value and effort requirements. Our analysis suggests an area ripe for future research and identifies important knowledge gaps. These gaps are attributable to the use of divergent definitions of effort, as well as highly heterogeneous methodologies, which limit our ability to generate strong conclusions about the intersection between effort and delay discounting processes.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Risk aversion—the preference for certainty over potential gains or losses—is reduced when using a foreign language. We investigated 2 mechanisms for this foreign language effect using incentivized gambles with verbal probability expressions: (1) that people perceive prospects of winning as larger when a decision is made in their foreign language; (2) that people experience reduced negative affect toward risk in a foreign language. In Experiment 1, N = 229 proficient Polish–English bilinguals, using ungridded slider, assigned numerical values to 29 verbal probability expressions in both languages. We found small bidirectional differences in 13 of them, leading us to reject the first mechanism. In Experiment 2, N = 281 participants gambled in incentivized neutral expected value lotteries using a sample of the verbal probability expressions from Experiment 1. Participants gambled in either their native or foreign language, where participants could either accept around 50% of gambles (debiased to risk-neutral) or more than 50% (biased to risk-seeking). Surprisingly, we observed no significant risk aversion in either language condition, with participants’ gambling behavior close to 50% in both cases. The finding that participants showed no risk aversion in native language condition meant we could not test whether foreign language reduces risk aversion. However, this result did show that using a foreign language does not promote excessive risk-taking. Our findings suggest that using verbal probability expressions does not bias participants’ responses, and may inherently reduce risk aversion.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Context effects occur when the preference between two alternatives is affected by the presence of an extra alternative. These effects are some of the most well studied phenomena in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision making. Recent research in this area has revealed an intriguing pattern of results. On the one hand, these effects are robust and ubiquitous. That is, they have been demonstrated in many domains and different choice settings. On the other hand, they are fragile and they disappear or even reverse under different conditions. This pattern of results has spurred debate and speculation about the cognitive mechanisms that drive these choices. The attraction effect, where the preference for an option increases in the presence of a dominated decoy, has generated the most controversy. In this registered report, we systematically vary factors that are known to be associated with the attraction effect to build a solid foundation of empirical results to aid future theory development. We find a robust attraction effect across the different conditions. The strength of this effect is modulated by the display order (e.g., decoy top, target middle, competitor bottom) and mode (numeric vs. graphical) but not display layout (by-attribute vs. by-alternative).</span>

However, graphs might also induce bias by shifting the amount of evidence needed to make a decision, such as deciding whether a treatment had some kind of effect. In 2 experiments, we manipulated the early base rates of treatment effects in graphs. Early base rates had a large effect on a signal detection measure of bias in future graphs even though all future graphs had a 50% chance of showing a treatment effect, regardless of earlier base rates. In contrast, the autocorrelation of data points within each graph had a larger effect on discriminability. Exploratory analyses showed that a simple cue could be used to correctly categorize most graphs, and we examine participants’ use of this cue among others in lens models. When exposed to multiple graphs on the same topic, human judges can draw conclusions about the data, but once those conclusions are made, they can affect subsequent graph judgment.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Sustainable financial investments play a role in mitigating climate change. With this research, we explored how decision-makers use three investment strategies illustrating different primary motives: (1) money maximization (economic self-interest), (2) exclusion (not personally harming the environment), and (3) inclusion (helping the environment most efficiently). The relative use of these strategies was tested within a novel investment paradigm, aiming to artificially create a trade-off between financial payoffs (money maximization), environmental purity (exclusion), and environmental impact (inclusion). We recruited 1422 participants online and let them make ten consecutive investment choices, with incentivized outcomes, both monetary (i.e., potential bonus payment) and environmental (i.e., number of trees planted). We tested the change in investment choices using a between-subject design with four conditions, a control, and one default condition for each investment strategy. The three strategies were chosen about equally often in the control condition, but we find that this investment pattern could be altered by a default intervention. Preliminary evidence suggests that participants primarily using the exclusion and inclusion strategies differ in their moral reasoning. Utilitarianism better predicted the inclusion strategy, whereas high self-importance of moral identity better predicted the exclusion strategy.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract To the known causes of overconfidence in decisions and judgments, we reveal another source that derives from a bias during the act of decision making. While this bias, the predecisional distortion of information, is well studied, its impact on overconfidence is not. We demonstrate how the distortion of information creates overconfidence in those professionals often regarded as singularly overconfident, entrepreneurs. When these professionals use a sequence of relevant information to make an accept-reject decision about a business opportunity, a cycle of confidence-distortion-confidence builds unjustified confidence in the chosen action – and does so whether that action is to accept or reject the venture. Overconfidence is a well-recognized cause of flawed decision making. Our work demonstrates the paradoxical converse of this claim, that flawed decision making can be a cause of overconfidence.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract This study investigated how alcohol intoxication and negative mood affect decision-making in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in a high-risk sample of adults who regularly drink alcohol. Using a 2×2 between-subjects design (N=160), we experimentally manipulated alcohol intoxication (target BrAC=.06% vs. .00%) and mood (negative vs. neutral) and employed computational modeling to identify underlying mechanisms. Results showed that alcohol intoxication impaired IGT performance, with intoxicated participants selecting fewer cards from advantageous decks (estimate=−8.12, 95% CI=[−12.83, −3.23]). Evidence for an effect of negative mood was moderate but inconclusive (estimate=−4.82, 95% CI=[−9.66, 0.02]). Computational modeling revealed that both alcohol (estimate=.13, 95% CI=[.05, .21]) and negative mood (estimate=.12, 95% CI=[.04, .20]) increased reward learning rates without affecting punishment learning rates. No interaction effects were observed. These findings suggest that impaired decision-making during alcohol intoxication and negative mood states stems from heightened sensitivity to immediate rewards rather than diminished sensitivity to punishments but these effects do not appear to be additive, providing novel insights into the computational mechanisms underlying alcohol-related decision-making deficits.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Advice taking is a crucial part of decision-making and has attracted the interest of scholars across the world. Laboratory research on advice taking has revealed several robust phenomena, such as sensitivity to advice quality or a tendency to underutilize advice. Despite extensive investigations in different countries, cultural differences in advice taking remain understudied. Knowing whether such cultural differences exist would not only be interesting from an academic standpoint but might also have consequences for multinational organizations and businesses. Here, we argue that prior laboratory research on cultural differences in advice taking is hindered by confounding factors, particularly the confound between participants’ cultural background and task difficulty. To draw a valid conclusion about cultural differences in advice taking, it is vital to develop a decision task devoid of this confound. Here, we develop such a judgment task and demonstrate that the core phenomena of advice taking manifest in a sample of German participants. We then use this task in a cross-national comparison of German and Chinese participants. While the core phenomena of advice taking consistently manifested in both samples, some differences emerged. Most notably, Chinese participants were more receptive of advice, even though they still underutilized it. This greater reliance on advice was driven by Chinese participants’ greater preference for averaging their own and the advisor’s judgments. We discuss how our findings extend current understanding of the nuanced interplay between cultural values and the dynamics of advice taking.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Some scholars have treated overconfidence as an individual difference—that is, assuming the tendency to be overconfident is stable within a person and differs meaningfully from person to person. We question this assumption. We investigate consistency within individuals between its three forms—overestimation, overplacement, and overprecision—in multiple domains (Study 1a and 1b), at multiple times (Study 1b and 2), and with multiple measures (Study 3a and 3b). We find mixed evidence of trait-like consistency. We do find some evidence of within-individual stability across domains and time points. However, we find little consistency across different measures of the same form of overconfidence—specifically overprecision. Instead, we find more consistent evidence that overconfidence varies situationally and contextually.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Addressing climate change requires substantial shifts in individual behavior. Providing information about climate externalities through carbon labels is a promising tool to foster sustainable choices when individuals weigh environmental against personal outcomes. We study the impact of carbon labels over time and their underlying mechanisms in a repeated risky choice task. We ran two preregistered experiments (US samples, N = 1,268) with realized carbon and monetary payoffs, examining how choice is influenced by the timing of carbon information (One-off vs. Recurring) and participants’ political preference (i.e., Democrat or Republican voters). In Study 1, we find that both Democrats and Republicans reduce carbon emissions when carbon labels were provided. Further, recurring labels significantly reduced carbon choices compared to one-off labels. Study 2 replicated the results in a within-participant design and showed that the impact of recurring carbon labels on sustainable choices cannot be explained by the strength of emission recall. This suggests that recurring labels amplify the importance given to the climate attribute in the decision process, operating via attentional rather than informational mechanisms. Our results emphasize the importance of providing climate externality information at time of use to raise awareness about climate costs and bolster sustainable preferences across population segments.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract In four studies, participants judged satisfaction with hypothetical salaries, given the salaries of others doing the same work. Unlike previous research, contexts (distributions of others’ salaries) were manipulated within- rather than between-subjects. These studies enabled tests of an extension of range–frequency (RF) theory that assumes that judgments are a compromise between RF predictions based on between- and within-trial contexts. This extension to within-subjects designs correctly predicted the cases in which people assign higher satisfaction ratings to lower salaries. The manipulation of the context within-subjects confirmed phenomena previously observed in between-subjects research. However, a violation of this within-subjects RF model was also observed: When one’s salary is lowest compared to others within the same firm, satisfaction varies inversely with the highest salary paid to another at the same firm. Apparently, judgments of satisfaction also depend on inequity. This finding was not observed in previous between-subjects research; indeed, salary and inequity are perfectly confounded for the participant in such a design. We theorize that satisfaction is not merely a judgment of where one’s salary falls relative to other salaries, but also depends on how much one is underpaid relative to the distribution of underpayments.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract The quality of information that informs decisions in expert domains such as law enforcement and national security often requires assessment based on meta-informational attributes such as source reliability and information credibility. Across 2 experiments with intelligence analysts ( n = 74) and nonexperts ( n = 175), participants rated the accuracy, informativeness, trustworthiness, and usefulness of information varying in source reliability and information credibility. The latter 2 attributes were communicated using ratings from the Admiralty Code, an information-evaluation system widely used in the defence and security domain since the 1940s. Ratings of accuracy, informativeness, and likelihood of use were elicited as repeated measures to examine intraindividual reliability. Across experiments, intraindividual reliability was best when levels of source reliability and information credibility were moderately consistent compared to when they were maximally inconsistent (i.e., one low and one high) or maximally consistent (both high or low). As well, trustworthiness ratings depended more on source reliability than on information credibility. Finally, the likelihood of using information was consistently predicted by accuracy ratings and not by judged informativeness or trustworthiness. The current findings offer insights into the ability of experts and novices to reliably use information-evaluation systems for structuring human judgments about intelligence.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Prior research has shown that people judge algorithmic errors more harshly than identical mistakes made by humans—a bias known as algorithm aversion. We explored this phenomenon across two studies ( N = 1199), focusing on the often-overlooked role of conventionality when comparing human versus algorithmic errors by introducing a simple conventionality intervention. Our findings revealed significant algorithm aversion when participants were informed that the decisions described in the experimental scenarios were conventionally made by humans. However, when participants were told that the same decisions were conventionally made by algorithms, the bias was significantly reduced—or even completely offset. This intervention had a particularly strong influence on participants’ recommendations of which decision-maker should be used in the future—even revealing a bias against human error makers when algorithms were framed as the conventional choice. These results suggest that the existing status quo plays an important role in shaping people’s judgments of mistakes in human–algorithm comparisons.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In hybrid foraging, foragers search for multiple targets in multiple patches throughout the foraging session, mimicking a range of real-world scenarios. This research examines outcome uncertainty, the prevalence of different target types, and the reward value of targets in human hybrid foraging. Our empirical findings show a consistent tendency toward risk-averse behavior in hybrid foraging. That is, people display a preference for certainty and actively avoid taking risks. While altering the prevalence or reward value of the risky targets does influence people&#39;s aversion to risk, the overall effect of risk remains dominant. Additionally, simulation results suggest that the observed risk-averse strategy is suboptimal in the sense that it prevents foragers from maximizing their overall returns. These results underscore the crucial role of outcome uncertainty in shaping hybrid foraging behavior and shed light on potential theoretical developments bridging theories in decision making and hybrid foraging.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Uncertainty presents a key challenge when learning how best to act to attain a desired outcome. People can report uncertainty in the form of confidence judgments, but how such judgments contribute to learning and subsequent decisions remains unclear. In a series of three experiments employing an operant learning task, we tested the hypothesis that confidence plays a central role in learning by regulating resource allocation to the seeking and processing of feedback. We predicted that, as participants&#39; confidence in their task knowledge grew, they would discount feedback when it was provided and be correspondingly less willing to pay for it when it was costly. Consistent with these predictions, we found that higher confidence was associated with reduced electrophysiological markers of feedback processing and decreased updating of beliefs following feedback receipt. Bayesian modeling suggests that this decrease in processing was due to a drop in the expected informative value of novel information when participants were highly confident. Thus, when choosing whether to pay a fee to receive further feedback, participants&#39; subjective confidence, rather than the objective accuracy of their decisions, guided their choices. Overall, our results suggest that confidence regulates learning and subsequent decision making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Many of the most interesting cognitive feats that humans perform require us to consider not just the things that actually occur but also alternative possibilities . We often do this explicitly (e.g., when imagining precisely how a first date could have gone better), but other times we do it spontaneously and implicitly (e.g., when thinking, &quot;I have to catch this bus,&quot; implying bad alternatives if the bus is not caught). A growing body of research has identified a core set of neural processes involved in explicit, episodic counterfactual thinking. Little is known, however, about the processes supporting the spontaneous, possibly implicit representation of alternatives. To make progress on this question, we induced participants to spontaneously generate counterfactual alternatives by asking them to judge whether agents were forced to make a particular choice or chose freely-a judgment that implicitly depends on their alternative options. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found 14 clusters that were preferentially engaged when participants were making force judgments (which elicit the spontaneous consideration of alternatives) compared to judgments of what actually occurred (which do not elicit alternatives). These clusters were widely distributed throughout the brain, including in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyri, bilateral posterior cingulate, and bilateral caudate. In many of these regions, we additionally show that variability in the neural signal correlates with trial-by-trial variability in participants&#39; force judgments. Our findings provide a first characterization of the neural substrates of the spontaneous representation of counterfactual alternatives.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Social interactions can be uncomfortable. The current research focuses on a particularly uneasy interaction that individuals face with their friends and acquaintances: the need to request owed money back. Nine preregistered studies ( N = 6,953) show that individuals&#39; approach to resolving interpersonal debt varies based on their closeness with the requestee. Specifically, people prefer communication methods low in social richness (e.g., digital apps) when requesting money back from weak social connections such as distant acquaintances. However, they prefer communication methods high in social richness (e.g., in-person interactions) when requesting money back from strong social connections such as close friends. Process evidence reveals the psychological dynamics at play: (a) people anticipate discomfort when requesting money back from distant acquaintances in person, driving them away from in-person requests and toward digital apps, and (b) people are more averse to appearing impersonal with close friends, driving them away from digital apps and toward in-person requests. In sum, individuals adaptively approach uncomfortable financial interactions based on the relationship dynamics at hand. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">It has long been hypothesized that episodic memory supports adaptive decision making by enabling mental simulation of future events. Yet, attempts to characterize this process are surprisingly rare. On one hand, memory research is often carried out in settings that are far removed from ecological contexts of decision making. On the other hand, models of adaptive choice only invoke episodic memory in highly stylized terms, if at all. To address these gaps, we propose TCM-SR, a novel process-level model that grounds model-based evaluation in empirically informed dynamics of episodic recall. In this model, the probability of retrieving each available memory is governed by the successor representation, a biologically plausible world model in reinforcement learning. The evolution of these probabilities based on past retrievals, in turn, is dictated by the temporal context model, a prominent model of episodic retrieval. Through simulations and analytical derivations, we show that the patterns of episodic retrieval suggested by this model enables flexible computation of decision variables. On this basis, a number of previously described features of episodic memory might serve an adaptive purpose in sequential decision making. For instance, we show that the contiguity effect, a well-known bias in episodic retrieval, enables mental simulation via model-based rollouts to inform decisions. We also show that backward retrieval and emotional modulation improve generalization and the efficiency of decisions given limited experience. By bridging computational models across these two domains, we make several theoretical and empirical predictions linking episodic memory to adaptive choice in sequential tasks.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Although the focus of research for decades, there is a surprising lack of consensus on what is (and what is not) self-control. We review some of the most prominent theoretical models of self-control, including those that highlight conflicts between smaller-sooner versus larger-later rewards, &quot;hot&quot; emotions versus &quot;cool&quot; cognitions, and efficient automatic versus resource-intensive controlled processes. After discussing some of their shortcomings, we propose an alternative approach based on tenets of construal level theory (Trope et al., 2021) that integrates these disparate models while also providing novel insights. Specifically, we model self-control as a problem of regulatory scope-the range of considerations one accounts for in any decision or behavior. Self-control conflicts occur when the pursuit of specific local opportunities threatens the ability to address motivational priorities that span a broader array of time, places, individuals, and possibilities. Whereas a more contractive consideration of relevant concerns may prompt indulgence in temptation, a more expansive consideration of concerns should not only help people identify the self-control conflict but also successfully resolve it. We review empirical evidence that supports this new framework and discuss implications and new directions. This regulatory framework not only clarifies what is and what is not self-control but also provides new insights that can be leveraged to enhance self-control in all its various forms.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsNoise is a pervasive feature of economic choice. However, standard economics experiments are not well equipped to study the noise because experiments are constrained: preferences are often either unknown or only imperfectly measured by experimenters. As a result of these designs – where the optimal choice is not observable to the analyst – many important questions about the noise in apparently random choice cannot be addressed. There is a long tradition in psychology of studying settings where subjects make choices about objectively measurable, but imperfectly perceived objects. We simply supplement this design with material incentives in a way that resembles economic choice. In our design, subjects make incentivized binary choices between lines and are paid a function of the length of the selected line. We find a gradual (not sudden) relationship between the difference in the lengths of the lines and the optimal choice. Our analysis suggests that the errors are better described as having a Gumbel distribution rather than a normal distribution, and our simulated data increase our confidence in this inference. We find evidence that suboptimal choices are associated with longer response times than optimal choices.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The Author(s)We investigate how gender affects ethical outcomes in repeated same- or mixed-gender interactions. In our first study (N = 681), we use an experimental slippery-slope audit setting (Gino and Bazerman, 2009), in which an “auditor” makes an approval decision about the emerging unethical behavior of an “estimator” whose gender has been made salient. Based on previous evidence, unethical behavior is more likely to be accepted when it emerges gradually compared to a situation where it occurs abruptly. While we do not find a general slippery-slope effect across the whole sample, a significant slippery-slope effect is detected when the estimator is male (d = 0.36) or when the auditor is female (d = 0.27). We observe no slippery-slope effects in same-gender estimator-auditor constellations. However, in mixed-gender constellations, we find opposite effects: when male estimators are audited by females, we observe a significant slippery-slope effect (d = 0.53), driven by a high approval rate in the slippery-slope treatment. Conversely, when female estimators are audited by males, the approval rate increases in the abrupt treatment (d = 0.33). To better understand the drivers of these findings, we asked a different sample of participants (N = 90) to indicate the level of competence or honesty they attribute to male and female estimators in the estimation task. Responses suggest that the detected slippery-slope effects may be driven by auditors (especially females), attributing more competence to male estimators (d = 0.62), which is particularly relevant in the slippery-slope treatment where unethical behavior is difficult to detect. Moreover, our finding that male auditors are particularly inclined to approve overvaluations by females in the abrupt treatment, where unethical behavior becomes salient, may be driven by a more ethical assessment of female estimators (d = 0.90).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Visual working memory (VWM) is a store for temporary maintenance of visual information. It is often disregarded, though, that information is typically stored to enable actions. Therefore, the context of these actions is of great importance for how VWM is used. Here, we questioned whether the severity of the consequence of an action might affect how well information is memorized, and how cautiously it is utilized. We employed an (online) copying task, in which participants reproduced an example display comprised of six items in a grid, using a pool of items. Crucially, we manipulated the severity of penalties: participants had to wait 5 (high) or 0.5 (low error cost) s after an error. Additionally, we manipulated the accessibility of task-relevant information (a well-studied manipulation in this paradigm): participants had to wait 5 (high) or 0.5 (low sampling cost) s to inspect the example. Our results show that with higher error cost the number of inspections remained comparable, but the number of errors decreased. Furthermore, they show that with higher sampling cost the number of inspections halved, and the number of errors increased. Thus, more severe action consequences increase the reluctance to act on uncertain information in VWM, but do not lead to more attempts to store information in VWM. We conclude that, in contrast to the effect of the accessibility of information, action consequences do not affect how well information is memorized, but affect how cautiously this stored information is utilized.
