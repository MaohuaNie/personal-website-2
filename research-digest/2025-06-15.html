                  <span style="color:#374151;">Children often have to choose between two or more probabilistically rewarded options. How early in life do they learn to choose adaptively? Connecting research on ecologically rational probability matching in adulthood with research on the benefits of cognitive immaturity in childhood, we compared children&#39;s (3-11 years; N = 362) and adults&#39; ( N = 121) repeated choice behavior in a child-friendly probability learning task. We implemented two static and one ecologically plausible statistical environment as between-subjects conditions. Behavioral and computational modeling analyses provided converging evidence for perseveration tendencies in 3- to 4-year-olds and adaptive choice diversification from age 6 years onward. On average, school-aged children showed a stronger tendency for exploration, whereas adults were better able to overcome this tendency in favor of exploitation. Our findings emphasize the importance of implementing ecologically plausible task environments in research on cognitive development and contribute a novel repeated choice perspective to the discussion on the adaptive functions of wide exploration in childhood.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Every action demands some effort, and its level influences decision making. Existing data suggest that in some decision contexts, effort devalues outcomes, but in other contexts, effort enhances outcome valuation. Here, we describe an empirical study and propose a model that incorporates negative, positive, and mixed impacts of effort on outcomes in different decision contexts and different participants. Participants chose between money and an item associated with varying levels of stair-climbing effort. Some participants had previous direct experience with a real physical effort and made decisions about a physically present reward. For other participants, the effort and the associated reward were always purely hypothetical. Furthermore, the decisions were framed as prospective or retrospective-before or after effort exertion. The key behavioral finding was that in the &quot;real&quot; condition, greater effort decreased outcome value when considered prospectively, but increased outcome value when considered retrospectively. Interestingly, even within the same decision context, individuals showed diverse relationships between effort and outcome value. These relationships ranged from those where greater effort increased value and decreased value to nonlinear patterns, where small effort initially increased outcome value but higher effort decreased it, or the other way around (initial decrease followed by a decrease). When our model was applied to participants&#39; individual choices, it was able to capture the monotonic and nonmonotonic relationships and outperformed previous solutions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Adults often titrate the degree of their cognitive effort in an economical manner: they &quot;think hard&quot; when the reward benefits of a task exceed its difficulty costs. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether and how children and adolescents adjust their cognitive effort according to multiple cues about its worthwhileness, including in novel environments where these cues must be learned through experience. Given that the processing of incentive and demand information changes with age, the present study examines participants&#39; (primary experiment N usable = 150, secondary experiment N usable = 150, ages 10-20 years) performance across two task-switching paradigms that manipulated the rewards offered for, and the difficulty of, engaging cognitive effort. In the primary experiment, reward cues were instructed but difficulty cues were learnable. In the secondary experiment, the reward and difficulty cues were both instructed, eliminating learning demands and effectively making the task easier. The primary experiment revealed that although less difficult contexts promoted greater accuracy at the group level, the regulation of cognitive effort according to higher and lower incentives emerged with age. Especially early in the task, older participants achieved greater accuracy for higher incentives. Younger participants, unexpectedly, achieved greater accuracy for lower incentives and adolescents performed similarly for each reward level. Nonetheless, participants of all ages self-reported trying their hardest for higher incentives, but only adults translated this aim into action. The secondary experiment revealed that in an overall easier task environment, cognitive effort did not become increasingly economical with age. Taken together, this pattern of findings suggests that different sources and amounts of information, and the conditions they are presented in, shape learning the value of cognitive effort from late childhood to early adulthood.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Narrow bracketing in combination with loss aversion has been shown to reduce individual risk taking. This is known as myopic loss aversion (MLA) and has been corroborated by many studies. Recent evidence has contested this notion, indicating that MLA’s applicability is confined to highly artificial settings. Given the impact of these findings, we reevaluated the evidence on MLA with substantially higher statistical power than in almost all previous studies. We systematically modified the seminal study design by Gneezy and Potters [Gneezy U, Potters J (1997) An experiment on risk taking and evaluation periods. Quart. J. Econom. 112(2):631–645] to include five key adjustments. These involved downscaled returns, return compounding, and extended investment horizons. Our results, which are highly robust to analytical heterogeneity, consistently document the presence of MLA across all experimental conditions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In this paper, we investigate market design for online gaming platforms. We ask what motivates people to continue participation—success or failure. Using data from an online chess platform, we find strong evidence of heterogeneous history-dependent stopping behavior. We identify two behavioral types of people: those who are more likely to stop playing after a loss and those who are more likely to stop playing after a win. We propose a behavioral dynamic choice model in which the utility from playing another game is directly affected by the previous game’s outcome. We estimate this time nonseparable preference model and conduct counterfactual analyses to study alternative market designs. A matching algorithm designed to leverage stopping behavior can substantially alter the length of play. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Mahmoud [ Mahmoud O (2022) The willingness to pay for diversification. Management Sci. 68(8):6235–6249] presents experimental evidence showing that people have an intrinsic preference for diversification that is driven by risk aversion and loss aversion, with risk-averse and loss-averse individuals being more willing to pay for diversification. We document numerous discrepancies between the results reported in the paper and the results calculated from the experimental data. In particular, the data show that risk-averse individuals are actually less willing to pay for diversification, whereas the effect of loss aversion is nonmonotonic and not statistically significant. We thus show that the data do not support the paper’s claim of a preference for diversification driven by risk aversion and loss aversion. This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Although the significance of narrative thinking has been increasingly recognized by social scientists, very little empirical research has documented its consequences for economically significant outcomes. The current paper addresses this gap in one important domain: valuations. In three experiments, participants were given the opportunity to sell an item they owned (mug in Study 1, hat in Studies 2 and 3) using an incentive-compatible procedure (multiple price list). Prior to making selling decisions, participants were randomly assigned to either a narrative treatment, in which they were asked to tell the story of their item, or a list treatment, in which they were asked to list the characteristics of their item. The narrative treatment led to significantly higher selling prices and increased rates of participants refusing all offered prices. We further explore potential mechanisms, and the impact of different types of narratives, by analyzing self-reported classifications of, and employing natural language processing techniques on, participants’ narratives.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How do individuals process nondiagnostic information? According to Bayes’ theorem, signals that do not carry relevant information are treated as if no signal occurred. This paper provides evidence that individuals update their expectations even after observing uninformative signals. Importantly, the direction in which they update depends on the valence of the signal. Prior beliefs become more optimistic after desirable uninformative signals and more pessimistic after undesirable uninformative signals. Our results provide novel insights why individuals form and entertain false beliefs in environments in which potentially new information is easily accessible but costly to verify (e.g., online media).

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Corporate managers overextrapolate past earnings in their earnings guidance, and this behavior is robust after including extensive controls, such as expectation management, earnings management, and overconfidence. The degree of overextrapolation is driven by the persistence of the underlying earnings process and other factors that affect representativeness heuristics, including trend, salience, and volatility. Experience and value diversity among corporate managers help mitigate this bias, whereas demographic diversity does not. Using the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we provide causal evidence that managers overextrapolate past earnings. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We develop a general equilibrium model in which investors simultaneously experience money and nominal price illusions. We show that the combined effects of these illusions widen the gap between the elasticities of the earnings yield of low- and high-priced stocks relative to the nominal interest rate. Empirically, we show that the compounded effects of money and nominal price illusions are stronger for low-priced stocks during periods of high inflation and economic downturns and for stocks with low institutional ownership. Our findings are robust when controlling for valuation uncertainties of low-priced stocks, including idiosyncratic volatility and firm age. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Piecewise-linear reward schemes are very common in workplaces; by definition, they divide the set of possible performance levels into disjoint intervals that could have psychological value to workers. When these schemes take the form of lump-sum bonuses, any psychological rewards associated with attaining a performance interval are hard to distinguish from material ones because both material and psychological incentives predict bunching at the output needed to earn the bonus. To disentangle these effects, this paper studies a common but understudied class of piecewise-linear pay—accelerators—in which the mechanisms’ predictions conflict. Using the distributions of daily sales in 103 small retail teams, we find that daily sales bunch at accelerators, which is inconsistent with models in which only material rewards matter. Combining simple theoretical models, institutional evidence, and heterogeneity analyses, we argue that this unexpected bunching results from teams’ decisions to use the convenient, salient kink points as shared goals, which yield symbolic utility to their members when the points are attained.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Humans and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms increasingly interact on unstructured managerial tasks. We propose that tailoring this human-AI interaction to align with individuals’ cognitive preferences is essential for enhancing performance. This hypothesis is examined through a field experiment in a multinational pharmaceutical firm. In the experiment, we manipulated four contextual parameters of human-AI interaction—work procedures, decision-making authority, training, and incentives—to align with sales experts’ cognitive styles, categorized as either adaptors or innovators. Our results show that tailored interaction significantly improves sales performance, whereas untailored interaction results in negative treatment effects compared with both the tailored and control conditions. Qualitative evidence suggests that this negative outcome arises from role conflicts and ambiguities in untailored interaction. Exploring the mechanisms underlying these outcomes further, a mediation analysis of AI login data reveals that human-AI interaction tailoring leads sales experts to adjust their AI utilization, which contributes to the observed performance outcomes. These findings support a human-centered approach to AI that prioritizes individuals’ information-processing needs and tailors their interaction with AI accordingly.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Information about the number of applicants to a job vacancy might simultaneously signal the degree of competition and vacancy quality. We study how this information affects job search. To do so, we conduct three experiments on a large online job platform in which the treatment varies what information is shown to job seekers. Information about the number of prior applicants to a vacancy increases the number of applications and redirects them to vacancies with few prior applications. Information about vacancy age increases application rates, especially to new vacancies. To further investigate the causal mechanisms, we conduct and analyze a survey choice experiment. We conclude that job seekers prefer to avoid competition rather than use the popularity of a vacancy as a signal of quality. This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Humans solve complex multistage decision problems using hierarchical and counterfactual strategies. Here we designed a task that reliably engages these strategies and conducted hypothesis-driven experiments to identify the computational constraints that give rise to them. We found three key constraints: a bottleneck in parallel processing that promotes hierarchical analysis, a compensatory but capacity-limited counterfactual process, and working memory noise that reduces counterfactual fidelity. To test whether these strategies are computationally rational—that is, optimal given such constraints—we trained recurrent neural networks under systematically varied limitations. Only recurrent neural networks subjected to all three constraints reproduced human-like behaviour. Further analysis revealed that hierarchical, counterfactual and postdictive strategies—typically viewed as distinct—lie along a continuum of rational adaptations. These findings suggest that human decision strategies may emerge from a shared set of computational limitations, offering a unifying framework for understanding the flexibility and efficiency of human cognition.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Previous research has demonstrated that attentional prioritization is shaped by prior experience of reward uncertainty: Attention is more likely to be captured by a stimulus associated with a variable (uncertain) reward than a stimulus that provides diagnostic information about available reward. This finding is noteworthy, because it runs counter to the principle that cognition is motivated to reduce uncertainty and hence surprise. Here we investigated whether this pattern of uncertainty-modulated attentional capture (UMAC) reflects a process of attention for learning, wherein uncertainty-related stimuli are prioritized in an attempt to learn about their true predictive status. To address this, we examined the distinct impact of two information sources that modulate potential for learning: explicit instruction versus ongoing experience of prediction error in reward feedback. Experiment 1 demonstrated that providing explicit instructions-and hence negating the need for further learning-did not reduce the magnitude of the UMAC effect, indicating that UMAC does not reflect attention for learning as a strategic approach for determining the task state. On the other hand, Experiment 2 showed that instructions alone were insufficient to generate a UMAC effect in the absence of reward feedback, suggesting that the impact of uncertainty on rapid attentional prioritization is driven by direct experience of prediction error. Taken together, these findings point to two possibilities: UMAC may reflect attention for learning operating at an implicit level or may evince an attentional system that is configured for rapid detection of sources of experienced uncertainty so that subsequent behavior can be tailored appropriately.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Prior research using attention-demanding tasks has shown that performance can be improved by allowing individuals to control the pacing of trials. This result suggests that people can monitor fluctuations of attention and can take advantage of this metacognitive awareness to synchronize moments with high demand to moments of heightened attention. In two experiments, we decomposed the benefits conferred by self-pacing within the context of a model of attentional capture rooted in signal detection theory. We employed a common orientation discrimination task in which set size varied across blocks of trials. Some subjects controlled the onset of each trial (self-pacing), and others did not. Model analyses revealed that self-pacing both increases target strength and decreases target variability. The between-trial wait times of self-pacing subjects supported the view that these benefits arise in part from the fact that participants appreciated the greater difficulty of larger set sizes and deployed a policy of waiting longer between trials during blocks with larger set sizes in order to offset the larger decrements associated with tasks of greater difficulty. Metacognitive control of self-pacing appears to benefit attention by enhancing the detectability of targets and by reducing the occurrence of target presentations during moments of lessened attention.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorStrategic behaviour often diverges from Nash-equilibrium, in particular in inexperienced play. Studying a class of games in which participants choose their payment and receive it as long as their opponent chooses a different amount, I show that none of the popular models of behavioural game theory predicts the predominant aggregate choice pattern consistently. And yet, noisy introspection (Goeree and Holt, 2004) readily accounts for about half of the individual observations. The reason for the apparent paradox and the mis-match of the aggregate data and the models is a disregarded behavioural type that makes up about 25% of the population. These 25% display a specific form of central-tendency bias, holding beliefs that peak in the centre of the option set and that are roughly symmetric. In addition, the players show a more heuristic process translating their belief into actions, as their choices cannot be explained readily by quantal responding. The behavioural pattern of a ‘centred belief’ in connection with boundedly-rational decision-making is present also in another prominent game from the literature on behavioural game theory, the 11–20 game. Finally, I show that classifying players as ‘heuristic centred-belief types’ by one game&#39;s beliefs has predictive power for behaviour in the other game.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The Author(s)More and more companies use artificial intelligence (AI). Research aimed to understand acceptance from the perspective of AI users or people affected by AI decisions. However, the perspective of decision-makers in companies (i.e., managers) has not been considered. To address this gap, we investigate managers’ acceptance of AI usage in companies, focusing on two potential determinants. Across four experimental studies (Ntotal = 2025), we tested whether the business area (i.e., human resources vs. finances/ marketing) and AI functionality affect managers’ acceptance of AI (i.e., perceived risk of negative consequences, willingness to invest). Findings indicate that managers (a) perceive more risk of and (b) are less willing to invest in AI usage in human resources than in finances and marketing. Besides, the results suggest that acceptance declines if functionality crosses a critical boundary and AI autonomously implements decisions without prior human control. Accordingly, the current research sheds light on the AI acceptance of managers and gives insights into the role of the business area and AI functionality.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 Elsevier B.V.More information today is becoming more accessible to more people at an ever-growing rate. How does epistemic curiosity operate in this expanding informational landscape? We test a novel theory which postulates that experienced curiosity is a function of two psychological factors: Interest, which is cognitive, “cool” and relatively stable in time, and Urge that is “hot” and quick to rise and decay. These factors determine one&#39;s experienced curiosity at any given point in time. Interestingly, these temporal dynamics may lead to time-dependent changes in epistemic choices. In a series of forced-choice experiments (n = 702), participants chose between receiving answers to either high-Urge or high-Interest questions. Consistent with predictions derived from our theory, we found a present-bias in preference for Urge. Our theory explains why, in stark contrast to individual interest and with the potential to derail public discourse, a competition for our attention inherently incentivizes the use of inciting and sensational information. We present and test a theory-based behavioral nudge that partially ameliorates these effects. Statement of relevance: Understanding the fundamentals of epistemic choices has important individual, societal, and economic implications. We develop and test a two-factor model, which captures cognitive and motivational determinants of curiosity. The model accounts for a modern-day paradox: how we chronically defer the consumption of information we find interesting (e.g., works of art and science), by succumbing to epistemic urges (e.g., finding the whereabouts of celebrities). From a societal perspective, an abundance of information in an environment that monetizes attention motivates the engineering of information for immediate engagement. We provide a novel psychological framework to describe the information attraction governing our daily lives. We also show how our theory may be used to allow people to consume more of the information they actually want, rather than the information they are tempted to consume.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsIn decision-making scenarios, individuals often face the challenge of balancing between exploring new options and exploiting known ones—a dynamic known as the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In such situations, people frequently have the opportunity to observe others&#39; actions. Yet little is known about when, how, and from whom individuals use observational learning in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. In two experiments, participants completed multiple nine-armed bandit tasks, either independently or while observing a fictitious agent using either an explorative or equally successful exploitative strategy. To analyze participants&#39; behaviors, we used a reinforcement learning model (simplified Kalman Filter) to extract parameters for both copying and exploration at the individual level. Results showed that participants copied the observed agents&#39; choices by adding a bonus to the individually estimated value of the observed action. While most participants appear to use an unconditional copying approach, a subset of participants adopted a copy-when-uncertain approach, that is copying more when uncertain about the optimal action based on their individually acquired knowledge. Further, participants adjusted their exploration strategies in alignment with those observed. We discuss, in how far this can be understood as a form of emulation. Results on participants&#39; preferences to copy from explorative versus exploitative agents are ambiguous. Contrary to expectations, similarity or dissimilarity between participants&#39; and agents&#39; exploration tendencies had no impact on observational learning. These results shed light on humans&#39; processing of social and non-social information in exploration scenarios and conditions of observational learning.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsThe existence of a close, if not direct, link between evaluation and action is widely assumed in the literature. Supporting this view, studies have shown that approach movements are executed faster in response to positive than negative stimuli, whereas avoidance responses are faster in response to negative than to positive stimuli (the often called “Approach/Avoidance—AA—compatibility effect”). However, this view has been challenged by proposals suggesting that this effect could be at least partially due to the use of affective information to answer the prevalent question individuals have in mind during the task. Consistent with these proposals, we report four preregistered studies showing that the AA compatibility effect can be moderated and even reversed by manipulating the question participants have in mind while doing an approach/avoidance task. In addition, results of a fifth experiment revealed that the AA compatibility effect emerged essentially among participants who reported simplifying the task by asking themselves whether they should approach (vs. not). These results suggest that the evaluation-action link is less direct than assumed and may be underlain by high-level cognitive processes.</span>

When these processes fail, the result is a kind of puzzle in which the value of a solution would be obvious once it is considered, but never gets considered in the first place. Recently, machine learning (ML) architectures have attained or even exceeded human performance on open-ended decision making tasks such as playing chess and Go. We ask whether the broad architectural principles that underlie ML success in these domains generate similar consideration failures to those observed in humans. We demonstrate a case in which they do, illuminating how humans make open-ended decisions, how this relates to ML approaches to similar problems, and how both architectures lead to characteristic patterns of success and failure.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024Social perception relies on the ability to understand the higher-order goals that drive other people&#39;s behaviour. Under predictive coding views, this ability relies on a Bayesian-like hypothesis-testing mechanism, which translates prior higher-order information about another agent&#39;s goals into perceptual predictions of the actions with which these goals can be realised and tests these predictions against the actual behaviour. We tested this hypothesis in three preregistered experiments. Participants viewed an agent&#39;s hand next to two possible target objects (e.g., donut, hammer) and heard the agent state a higher-order goal, which could be fulfilled by one of the two objects (e.g., “I&#39;m really hungry!”). The hand then reached towards the objects and disappeared at an unpredictable point mid-motion, and participants reported its last seen location. The results revealed the hypothesized integration of prior goals and observed hand trajectories. Reported hand disappearance points were predictively shifted towards the object with which the goal could be best realised. These biases were stronger when goal statements were explicitly processed (Experiment 1) than when passively heard (Experiment 2), more robust for more ambiguous reaches, and they could not be explained by attentional shifts towards the objects or participants&#39; awareness of the experimental hypotheses. Moreover, similar biases were not elicited (Experiment 3) when the agent&#39;s statements referred to the same objects but did not specify them as action goals (e.g., “I&#39;m really not hungry!”). These findings link action understanding to predictive/Bayesian mechanisms of social perception and Theory of Mind and provide the first evidence that prior knowledge about others&#39; higher-level goals cascades to lower-level action expectations, which ultimately influence the visuospatial representation of others&#39; behaviour.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024A large literature debates whether belief polarization, in both experiments and real-world political opinion data, is the result of biased forms of reasoning like biased assimilation and motivated reasoning, or if it can be caused by rational reasoning. We present evidence for the plausibility of a novel Bayesian mechanism of experimental and real-world political belief polarization involving perceptions of source independence. We show, using a novel Bayesian network, that when presented with conflicting testimony from two source groups, Bayesians should update towards the position of the group they deem to be more independent, meaning those who disagree about which group that is should polarize. We find in a pre-registered experiment (N = 351) that human participants polarize under these conditions. We then find in a UK study (N = 507) and a pre-registered US replication (N = 300) that, using a novel scale instrument, real-world partisans (Labour, Conservative, Republican, and Democrat) perceive their party&#39;s supporters to be more independent than the opposing party&#39;s supporters, with large average effect sizes (d = 0.87 UK, d = 0.82 US), suggesting the conditions are in place for such polarization to occur in the real world. Accordingly, we find that those who view their party&#39;s supporters as more independent than their opponents to the greatest extent have the most polarized beliefs, even after controlling for partisanship and affective polarization. Overall, our results highlight perceptions of testimonial independence as a plausible mediator of experimental and real-world belief polarization.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025While experts consistently demonstrate superior action anticipation within their domains, the computational mechanisms underlying this ability remain unclear. This study investigated how the processing of kinematic invariants contributes to expert performance by examining table tennis players, volleyball players, and novices across two table tennis serve anticipation tasks using normal and point-light displays. Employing the kinematic coding framework, we established encoding and readout models to predict both actual action outcomes and participants&#39; responses. Results showed that table tennis players consistently outperformed other groups across both tasks. Analysis of the intersection between encoding and readout models revealed a distinct mechanism: while both athlete groups showed enhanced ability to identify informative kinematic features compared to novices, only table tennis players demonstrated superiority in correctly utilizing these features to make precise predictions. This advantage in invariants mapping showed a positive correlation with domain-specific training experience and remained consistent across display formats, suggesting the development of a robust internal model through sustained domain-specific experience. Our findings illuminate the computational bases of domain-specific action anticipation, highlighting the significance of kinematic invariants mapping superiority in experts.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">The gambler’s fallacy is typically defined as the false belief that a random event is less likely to occur if it has occurred recently. Although forms of this fallacy have been documented numerous times, past work either has not actually measured probabilistic predictions but rather point predictions or used sequences that were not independent. To address these problems, we conducted a series of high-powered, preregistered studies in which we asked 750 adult Amazon Mechanical Turk workers from the United States to report probabilistic predictions for truly independent sequences. In contrast to point predictions, which generated a significant gambler’s fallacy, probabilistic predictions were not found to lead to a gambler’s fallacy. Moreover, the point predictions could not be reconstructed by sampling from the probability judgments. This suggests that the gambler’s fallacy originates at the decision stage rather than in probabilistic reasoning, as posited by several leading theories. New theories of the gambler’s fallacy may be needed to explain these findings.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Data and computational capacity are essential resources for any intelligent system that update its beliefs by integrating new information. However, both of these resources are inherently limited. Here, we introduce a new resource-rational analysis of belief updating that formalizes these constraints using information-theoretic principles. Our analysis reveals an interaction between data and computational limitations: when computational resources are scarce, agents may struggle to fully incorporate new data. The resource-rational belief updating rule we derive provides a novel explanation for conservative Bayesian updating, where individuals tend to underweight the likelihood of new evidence. Our theory also generates predictions consistent with several process models, particularly those based on approximate Bayesian inference.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Serial tasks in behavioral research often lead to correlated responses, invalidating the application of generalized linear models and leaving the analysis of serial correlations as the only viable option. We present a Bayesian analysis method suitable for classifying even relatively short behavioral series according to their correlation structure. Our classifier consists of three phases. Phase 1 distinguishes between mono- and possible multifractal series by modeling the distribution of the increments of the series. To the series labeled as monofractal in Phase 1, classification proceeds in Phase 2 with a Bayesian version of the evenly spaced averaged detrended fluctuation analysis (Bayesian esaDFA). Finally, Phase 3 refines the estimates from the Bayesian esaDFA. We tested our classifier with very short series (viz., 256 points), both simulated and empirical ones. For the simulated series, our classifier revealed to be maximally efficient in distinguishing between mono- and multifractality and highly efficient in assigning the monofractal class. For the empirical series, our classifier identified monofractal classes specific to experimental designs, tasks, and conditions. Monofractal classes are particularly relevant for skilled, repetitive behavior. Short behavioral series are crucial for avoiding potential confounders such as mind wandering or fatigue. Our classifier thus contributes to broadening the scope of time series analysis for behavioral series and to understanding the impact of fundamental behavioral constructs (e.g., learning, coordination, and attention) on serial performance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Previous studies have documented a preference for clockwise (CW) over counterclockwise (CCW) rotation in various visual tasks, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To determine at what stage the CW bias emerges, we tested this preference across multiple visual awareness paradigms using consistent 2D rotation stimuli. In Experiment 1, we found a strong CW bias in apparent motion, with CW dominating perception 1.6 times longer than CCW during long‐term presentations and eliciting an average of 74% CW percepts in short‐term presentations. By contrast, no CW bias was observed in binocular rivalry, suggesting its absence in low‐level perceptual conflict. Experiment 2 employed the breaking continuous flash suppression (b‐CFS) paradigm to assess unconscious preferences, revealing no difference in breakthrough times between CW and CCW rotations. Specifically, although apparent motion stimuli showed a higher frequency of CW percepts, breakthrough times for stimuli reported as CW and CCW were similar, indicating that the CW bias occurs after stimuli reach awareness. In Experiment 3, we manipulated the ambiguity of apparent motion stimuli and found significant interactions between the CW bias and input ambiguity, further ruling out a fixed sensory or response bias. These findings suggest that the CW bias in 2D rotation may be driven by higher‐level cognitive processes, offering insights into how the visual system resolves perceptual ambiguity.</span>
