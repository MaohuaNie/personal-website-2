                  <span style="color:#374151;">Narrow bracketing in combination with loss aversion has been shown to reduce individual risk taking. This is known as myopic loss aversion (MLA) and has been corroborated by many studies. Recent evidence has contested this notion, indicating that MLA’s applicability is confined to highly artificial settings. Given the impact of these findings, we reevaluated the evidence on MLA with substantially higher statistical power than in almost all previous studies. We systematically modified the seminal study design by Gneezy and Potters [Gneezy U, Potters J (1997) An experiment on risk taking and evaluation periods. Quart. J. Econom. 112(2):631–645] to include five key adjustments. These involved downscaled returns, return compounding, and extended investment horizons. Our results, which are highly robust to analytical heterogeneity, consistently document the presence of MLA across all experimental conditions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper develops a new approach to volatility ambiguity and studies its implications for equilibrium consumption, portfolio choice, and asset prices. Our approach does not require equivalence between priors. The measure of ambiguity is based on the statistical confidence in the reference model that can be assessed with sample statistics. The approach is analytically tractable and amenable to empirical/calibration analysis. A stochastic discount pricing formula is given. At sensible levels of volatility ambiguity, the empirical regularity of equity premium and consumption growth in U.S. data can be the equilibrium outcome of our model featuring a relative risk aversion (RRA) coefficient within a reasonable range.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In this paper, we investigate market design for online gaming platforms. We ask what motivates people to continue participation—success or failure. Using data from an online chess platform, we find strong evidence of heterogeneous history-dependent stopping behavior. We identify two behavioral types of people: those who are more likely to stop playing after a loss and those who are more likely to stop playing after a win. We propose a behavioral dynamic choice model in which the utility from playing another game is directly affected by the previous game’s outcome. We estimate this time nonseparable preference model and conduct counterfactual analyses to study alternative market designs. A matching algorithm designed to leverage stopping behavior can substantially alter the length of play. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Multi-armed bandit has been well known for its efficiency in online decision-making in terms of minimizing the loss of the participants’ welfare during experiments (i.e., the regret). In clinical trials and many other scenarios, the statistical power of inferring the treatment effects (i.e., the gaps between the mean outcomes of different arms) is also crucial. Nevertheless, minimizing the regret entails harming the statistical power of estimating the treatment effect because the observations from some arms can be limited. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between efficiency and statistical power by casting the multi-armed bandit experimental design into a minimax multi-objective optimization problem. We introduce the concept of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize the situation in which neither the statistical power nor the efficiency can be improved without degrading the other. We derive a useful sufficient and necessary condition for the Pareto optimal solutions to the minimax multi-objective optimization problem. Additionally, we design an effective Pareto optimal multi-armed bandit experiment that can be tailored to different levels of the trade-off between the two objectives. Moreover, we extend the design and analysis to the setting where the outcome of each arm consists of an adversarial baseline reward and a stochastic treatment effect, demonstrating the robustness of our design. Finally, motivated by clinical trials, we examine the setting where the employed experiment must split the experimental units into a small number of batches, and we propose a flexible Pareto optimal design.

Management Sci. 68(8):6235–6249] presents experimental evidence showing that people have an intrinsic preference for diversification that is driven by risk aversion and loss aversion, with risk-averse and loss-averse individuals being more willing to pay for diversification. We document numerous discrepancies between the results reported in the paper and the results calculated from the experimental data. In particular, the data show that risk-averse individuals are actually less willing to pay for diversification, whereas the effect of loss aversion is nonmonotonic and not statistically significant. We thus show that the data do not support the paper’s claim of a preference for diversification driven by risk aversion and loss aversion. This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How do individuals process nondiagnostic information? According to Bayes’ theorem, signals that do not carry relevant information are treated as if no signal occurred. This paper provides evidence that individuals update their expectations even after observing uninformative signals. Importantly, the direction in which they update depends on the valence of the signal. Prior beliefs become more optimistic after desirable uninformative signals and more pessimistic after undesirable uninformative signals. Our results provide novel insights why individuals form and entertain false beliefs in environments in which potentially new information is easily accessible but costly to verify (e.g., online media).

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Corporate managers overextrapolate past earnings in their earnings guidance, and this behavior is robust after including extensive controls, such as expectation management, earnings management, and overconfidence. The degree of overextrapolation is driven by the persistence of the underlying earnings process and other factors that affect representativeness heuristics, including trend, salience, and volatility. Experience and value diversity among corporate managers help mitigate this bias, whereas demographic diversity does not. Using the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we provide causal evidence that managers overextrapolate past earnings. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">A significant portion of U.S. households enters and exits investment accounts. Empirically, income and wealth changes are related to these transitions, with income changes not affecting the retired. A life cycle model with participation costs cannot match the observed ownership dynamics, but an extension with stock market crash better fits the average participation rate and ownership transitions of the middle-aged and retired. This extended model does not match the ownership dynamics of the young, which are better captured by a model with elevated income risk. Overall, these findings indicate that ownership transitions respond to wealth shocks across the life cycle, both in our model and the data. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We develop a general equilibrium model in which investors simultaneously experience money and nominal price illusions. We show that the combined effects of these illusions widen the gap between the elasticities of the earnings yield of low- and high-priced stocks relative to the nominal interest rate. Empirically, we show that the compounded effects of money and nominal price illusions are stronger for low-priced stocks during periods of high inflation and economic downturns and for stocks with low institutional ownership. Our findings are robust when controlling for valuation uncertainties of low-priced stocks, including idiosyncratic volatility and firm age. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Piecewise-linear reward schemes are very common in workplaces; by definition, they divide the set of possible performance levels into disjoint intervals that could have psychological value to workers. When these schemes take the form of lump-sum bonuses, any psychological rewards associated with attaining a performance interval are hard to distinguish from material ones because both material and psychological incentives predict bunching at the output needed to earn the bonus. To disentangle these effects, this paper studies a common but understudied class of piecewise-linear pay—accelerators—in which the mechanisms’ predictions conflict. Using the distributions of daily sales in 103 small retail teams, we find that daily sales bunch at accelerators, which is inconsistent with models in which only material rewards matter. Combining simple theoretical models, institutional evidence, and heterogeneity analyses, we argue that this unexpected bunching results from teams’ decisions to use the convenient, salient kink points as shared goals, which yield symbolic utility to their members when the points are attained.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Humans solve complex multistage decision problems using hierarchical and counterfactual strategies. Here we designed a task that reliably engages these strategies and conducted hypothesis-driven experiments to identify the computational constraints that give rise to them. We found three key constraints: a bottleneck in parallel processing that promotes hierarchical analysis, a compensatory but capacity-limited counterfactual process, and working memory noise that reduces counterfactual fidelity. To test whether these strategies are computationally rational—that is, optimal given such constraints—we trained recurrent neural networks under systematically varied limitations. Only recurrent neural networks subjected to all three constraints reproduced human-like behaviour. Further analysis revealed that hierarchical, counterfactual and postdictive strategies—typically viewed as distinct—lie along a continuum of rational adaptations. These findings suggest that human decision strategies may emerge from a shared set of computational limitations, offering a unifying framework for understanding the flexibility and efficiency of human cognition.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract We study the association of the perseverance of effort and the consistency of interests components of the psychological measure of grit with economic measures of impatience and time inconsistency in the general population. We find that impatience is associated with grit through the perseverance of effort component. No association of time inconsistency with grit is found. Predicting participants’ financial and health outcomes and behaviors, we find that impatience and grit are predictive for both outcomes, but this is not the case for time inconsistency. Our findings suggest that it can be beneficial for empirical studies of intertemporal decisions to include economic impatience and psychological grit measures.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">The gambler’s fallacy is typically defined as the false belief that a random event is less likely to occur if it has occurred recently. Although forms of this fallacy have been documented numerous times, past work either has not actually measured probabilistic predictions but rather point predictions or used sequences that were not independent. To address these problems, we conducted a series of high-powered, preregistered studies in which we asked 750 adult Amazon Mechanical Turk workers from the United States to report probabilistic predictions for truly independent sequences. In contrast to point predictions, which generated a significant gambler’s fallacy, probabilistic predictions were not found to lead to a gambler’s fallacy. Moreover, the point predictions could not be reconstructed by sampling from the probability judgments. This suggests that the gambler’s fallacy originates at the decision stage rather than in probabilistic reasoning, as posited by several leading theories. New theories of the gambler’s fallacy may be needed to explain these findings.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Data and computational capacity are essential resources for any intelligent system that update its beliefs by integrating new information. However, both of these resources are inherently limited. Here, we introduce a new resource-rational analysis of belief updating that formalizes these constraints using information-theoretic principles. Our analysis reveals an interaction between data and computational limitations: when computational resources are scarce, agents may struggle to fully incorporate new data. The resource-rational belief updating rule we derive provides a novel explanation for conservative Bayesian updating, where individuals tend to underweight the likelihood of new evidence. Our theory also generates predictions consistent with several process models, particularly those based on approximate Bayesian inference.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Adults often titrate the degree of their cognitive effort in an economical manner: they &quot;think hard&quot; when the reward benefits of a task exceed its difficulty costs. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether and how children and adolescents adjust their cognitive effort according to multiple cues about its worthwhileness, including in novel environments where these cues must be learned through experience. Given that the processing of incentive and demand information changes with age, the present study examines participants&#39; (primary experiment Nusable = 150, secondary experiment Nusable = 150, ages 10-20 years) performance across two task-switching paradigms that manipulated the rewards offered for, and the difficulty of, engaging cognitive effort. In the primary experiment, reward cues were instructed but difficulty cues were learnable. In the secondary experiment, the reward and difficulty cues were both instructed, eliminating learning demands and effectively making the task easier. The primary experiment revealed that although less difficult contexts promoted greater accuracy at the group level, the regulation of cognitive effort according to higher and lower incentives emerged with age. Especially early in the task, older participants achieved greater accuracy for higher incentives. Younger participants, unexpectedly, achieved greater accuracy for lower incentives and adolescents performed similarly for each reward level. Nonetheless, participants of all ages self-reported trying their hardest for higher incentives, but only adults translated this aim into action. The secondary experiment revealed that in an overall easier task environment, cognitive effort did not become increasingly economical with age. Taken together, this pattern of findings suggests that different sources and amounts of information, and the conditions they are presented in, shape learning the value of cognitive effort from late childhood to early adulthood.
