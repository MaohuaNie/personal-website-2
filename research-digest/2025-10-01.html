                  <span style="color:#374151;">Characterizing behavior in sequential problems is often complicated by the presence of multiple decision rules with overlapping predictions. To address this issue, we introduce a new experimental and econometric approach for identifying decision strategies in sequential contexts. This approach consists of eliciting conditional strategies (as opposed to direct choices) and measuring policy adherence via maximum-likelihood estimation (as opposed to counting coincidences). Applying this approach to several common types of sequential problems increases the proportion of uniquely identifiable subjects by up to a third relative to standard methods and yields the following findings. First, in search and stopping problems, decision makers respond less strongly to state and time of the dynamic problem than in problems that do not have a stopping structure. Second, decision rules are often biased toward being more accepting (less demanding) than the optimal policy would predict. Third, the format used to elicit decisions (menu-based choice versus numeric threshold entry) has a significant effect on policy adoption. In addition to identifying decision rules that better fit observed behavior in dynamic choice problems, these results have implications for firms serving customers who face sequential decisions. We use a revenue management example (optimal subscription service pricing) to show that failing to account for the relevant decision rules can reduce firm profits by up to 54%.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We introduce formal measures for two psychological factors of probabilistic risk attitudes: attractiveness (motivational factor) and discriminability (cognitive factor). Unlike previous approaches that relied on heuristic proxies, our measures precisely capture these two fundamental factors. Our measures are mathematically tractable, robust to discontinuities, such as in the NEO-additive case, and flexible to be applied to any weighting function, as well as to both small and large probabilities. Additionally, through detailed numerical analysis, we examine to what extent existing weighting function parameters capture the two factors: attractiveness and discriminability. Finally, using these new measures, we provide a formal understanding of the independence between motivational and cognitive factors.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We experimentally study dynamic resource allocation decisions using product development as the context. A product manager must accept or reject a series of design improvement opportunities, given a limited budget. Human subjects perform well when the cost-to-implement is fixed throughout the project. However, in a more complex setting where the cost increases for the latter half of the project, subjects’ performance worsens substantially. We use the strategy frequency estimation method to analyze subjects’ decision mechanisms and find that many subjects are (a) mis-weighting future periods (underweighting in the simple case, overweighting in the complex) and (b) focusing on only the highest value opportunities. These heuristics perform poorly in the complex setting, leading to excess savings and are a counterproductive reaction to the cost increase. Top performers in the complex setting do well by decomposing the problem into two subproblems resembling the simpler setting, which they can handle nearly optimally. In a second study, we test managerial interventions based on prompting this decomposition approach to improve performance in the complex setting. Merely prompting subjects to consider problem decomposition is largely ineffective. However, additionally sharing a “best practice” budget plan that gives information about how and why top performers decompose the problem significantly improves performance. Our results highlight when decision makers will perform well or poorly in a dynamic resource allocation problem and show effective ways to reframe the problem and improve their performance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Statistical discrimination relies on people inferring unobservable characteristics of group members based on their beliefs about the group. Across four preregistered experiments (N = 9,002), we show that accurate information about the composition of top performers can induce incorrect beliefs about performance differences across groups when the groups are of unequal size. Because people fail to account for base rates, they underestimate the performance of individuals from smaller groups. As a result, when participants in our experiments receive true information about the gender composition of top performers in a male-dominated candidate pool, they are less likely to hire women, even when there are no gender differences in performance (Study 1). Similarly, they are less likely to hire better-performing non-White candidates when the racial demographics of the candidate pool reflect the U.S. population (Study 4). We show that these choices reflect an error in statistical reasoning, rather than being motivated by a desire to discriminate against any particular group (Study 2). Despite leading to less accurate beliefs, participants disproportionately seek out information about top performers when given the choice, and discrimination thus persists when information selection is endogenous (Study 3).

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Humans often face decisions between multiple alternatives. In these contexts, some evidence suggests that only the alternative with the highest evidence is represented by the decision system. However, other findings indicate that unchosen alternatives&#39; information remains available for decision computations. To evaluate how much information from unchosen alternatives is accessible by the decision system, we employed a second-guess paradigm: When participants selected an incorrect alternative, they were given a second opportunity to make a new choice. By fitting computational models to data from two preregistered experiments involving four (Experiment 1) and 12 (Experiment 2) alternatives, we found evidence for an intermediate position: After the first decision is made, noise corrupts the evidence from the initially unchosen options, suggesting that the decision system cannot access all the sensory evidence available to perform a second decision. We extended this finding by fitting the models to two previously published data sets involving different stimuli and numbers of alternatives (six and three) and found concordant evidence. In addition, we also evaluated the amount of information accessible by the metacognitive system, responsible for monitoring our behavior and reflecting upon the correctness of our decisions. We found that incorporating a separate channel of evidence unaffected by noise for metacognitive computations improves model fitting, suggesting that the decision system accesses less evidence than the metacognitive system. These results reconcile previous conflicting findings in multialternative decisions and highlight a dissociation between decision making and metacognition, offering new insights into the fundamental constraints of decision processes and the relative robustness of metacognitive evaluations.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Social norms shape a vast range of human behaviors, from everyday interactions to major life choices. Yet, existing theories of norm emergence typically focus either on why certain norms arise (substantive properties) or on how they spread and persist (dynamical properties), often making conflicting assumptions. Here, we propose a unified account in which norms prescribing how one ought to act emerge naturally from the fundamental algorithms that guide learning-whether in social or nonsocial settings. Our account builds on recent advances in decision making and emotion research that have highlighted &quot;actor-critic&quot; models as a core mechanism of learning from feedback. We extend this mechanism to social settings by assuming that it is not only we who critique our actions; others critique our actions as well. By simulating this interindividual form of learning, we show that it uniquely produces group behavior that exhibits both substantive and dynamical properties of real-world social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, S-shaped curves, and local conformity/global diversity. Our framework thus offers a uniquely parsimonious way to bridge the gap between individual learning and group behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Multitasking research has shown that individuals differ in whether they prefer a more serial or a more parallel mode of task processing at the level of whole tasks. Such preferences can be identified using the task switching with preview (TSWP) paradigm. This paradigm allows, but does not require, individuals to preview the stimulus of the next task switch in a predictable task switching procedure [AAABBB...]. Although several studies have shown that some participants consistently use the preview information, it is still unclear when exactly this information is used and, thus, how parallel processing takes place. The present study is an important step in clarifying this issue. In two experiments, I investigated when exactly individuals who prefer parallel processing during task switching use a preview to prepare for the next task switch. In Experiment 1, the onset and thus the length of the preview was varied within participants. This allowed to disentangle whether parallel processing of the preview depends on the length of the preview (i.e., its likelihood increases with longer preview presentation), or occurs contingent on a single trial (i.e., is a rapid process). Strikingly, parallel processing occurred regardless of preview duration, suggesting that a short preview may be sufficient. In Experiment 2, participants received the preview in discrete steps, i.e., with the same length throughout the sequence. There was a clear peak in the use of the preview immediately before a task switch. This suggests that although individuals who prefer parallel processing are able to process information in parallel throughout a task sequence, they clearly prefer to do so just before the task switch.</span>
