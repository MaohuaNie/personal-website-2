                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsDiffusion Decision Models (DDMs) are a widely used class of models that assume an accumulation of evidence during a quick decision. These models are often used as measurement models to assess individual differences in cognitive processes such as evidence accumulation rate and response caution. An underlying assumption of these models is that there is internal noise in the evidence accumulation process. We argue that this internal noise is a relevant psychological construct that is likely to vary over participants and explain differences in cognitive ability. In some cases a change in noise is a more parsimonious explanation of joint changes in speed-accuracy tradeoffs and ability. However, fitting traditional DDMs to behavioral data cannot yield estimates of an individual&#39;s evidence accumulation rate, caution, and internal noise at the same time. This is due to an intrinsic unidentifiability of these parameters in DDMs. We explored the practical consequences of this unidentifiability by estimating the Bayesian joint posterior distributions of parameters (and thus joint uncertainty) for simulated data. We also introduce methods of estimating these parameters. Fundamentally, these parameters can be identified in two ways: (1) We can assume that one of the three parameters is fixed to a constant. We show that fixing one parameter, as is typical in fitting DDMs, results in parameter estimates that are ratios of true cognitive parameters including the parameter that is fixed. By fixing another parameter instead of noise, different ratios are estimated, which may be useful for measuring individual differences. (2) Alternatively, we could use additional observed variables that we can reasonably assume to be related to model parameters. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data or single-unit activity from animals can yield candidate measures. We show parameter recovery for models with true (simulated) connections to such additional covariates, as well as some recovery in misspecified models. We evaluate this approach with both single-trial and participant-level additional observed variables. Our findings reveal that with the integration of additional data, it becomes possible to discern individual differences across all parameters, enhancing the utility of DDMs without relying on strong assumptions. However, there are some important caveats with these new modeling approaches, and we provide recommendations for their use. This research paves the way to use the deeper theoretical understanding of sequential sampling models and the new modeling methods to measure individual differences in internal noise during decision-making.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025Studying metacognition, the introspection of one&#39;s own decisions, can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the decisions. Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing implicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer&#39;s uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer&#39;s responses.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsThe past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum-like (QL) modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena, there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach. In this paper, we develop a QL representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on generalized probability theory (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework (see section 2.1 for comparison of classical, quantum, and generalized probability theories). Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect-observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments — a critical aspect of this model. Under the specific assumption regarding neuronal connectivity, the compound system S=(S1,S2) of neuronal networks is represented using the tensor product. This S1⊗S2 representation significantly enhances the computational power of S. The GPT-based approach successfully replicates key QL effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects — phenomena often associated with decision interference. Additionally, this framework enables QL modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions like depression and epilepsy. While the focus of this paper is primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a broad range of biological and social networks. Furthermore, it supports the claims of superiority made by quantum-inspired computing and can serve as the foundation for developing QL-based AI systems, specifically utilizing the QL representation of oscillator networks.</span>

It expands the shortest-path space concept to include a wider range of optimization problems, where each move can be weighted by a real number representing its “value”. Depending on the application, the “value” could be a cost, waiting time, route length, etc. This new model, named the optimizing path space, comprises all the globally best solutions. Additionally, it sets the stage for evaluating human problem-solving skills in various areas, like cognitive and neuropsychological tests, experimental studies, and puzzles, where globally optimal solutions are required.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The Author(s)Intertemporal choices are conventionally conceived as decisions about whether to be better off sooner or later. As a reflection of this, most experimental research on the topic has been restricted to choices between single-dated outcomes: One sooner, the other later. Even these decisions, however, can be conceived in a different way: As choices between an option that accumulates faster to its total outcome, and an option that accumulates more slowly to its total outcome. To empirically distinguish between these two interpretations, the experimental design must include options with multiple-dated outcomes, that is, outcome sequences. We report an experiment that includes choices involving outcome sequences as well as choices between single-dated outcomes, where the outcomes are monetary losses, or payments. This design allows us to evaluate a sooner-or-later model and a faster-or-slower model on their ability to predict single-payment choices once calibrated on payment-sequence choices (model generalizability). Moreover, people differ considerably in their preferences for the timing of losses, which we turn to our advantage by evaluating the models on their ability to associate preferences for the timing of multiple payments, as inferred from payment-sequence choices, with preferences for the timing of a single payment, as observed in single-payment choices (parameter generalizability). For that purpose, we develop the classic criteria of convergent validity and discriminant validity in the assessment of construct validity as criteria in the assessment of model validity. The results of a fully Bayesian analysis strongly favored the faster-or-slower model over the sooner-or-later model.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 Elsevier Inc.Spatial navigation involves the use of various cues. This study examined how cue conflict influences navigation by contrasting landmarks and optic flow. Participants estimated spatial distances under different levels of cue conflict: minimal conflict, large conflict, and large conflict with explicit awareness of landmark instability. Whereas increased cue conflict alone had little behavioral impact, adding explicit awareness reduced reliance on landmarks and impaired the precision of spatial localization based on them. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we tested two cognitive models: a Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model and a non-Bayesian sensory disparity model. The BCI model provided a better fit to the data, revealing two independent mechanisms for reduced landmark reliance: increased sensory noise for unstable landmarks and lower weighting of unstable landmarks when landmarks and optic flow were judged to originate from different causes. Surprisingly, increased cue conflict did not decrease the prior belief in a common cause, even when explicit awareness of landmark instability was imposed. Additionally, cue weighting in the same-cause judgment was determined by bottom-up sensory reliability, while in the different-cause judgment, it correlated with participants’ subjective evaluation of cue quality, suggesting a top-down metacognitive influence. The BCI model further identified key factors contributing to suboptimal cue combination in minimal cue conflicts, including the prior belief in a common cause and prior knowledge of the target location. Together, these findings provide critical insights into how navigators resolve conflicting spatial cues and highlight the utility of the BCI model in dissecting cue interaction mechanisms in navigation.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Many products are most meaningfully described using unstructured data such as text or images. Unstructured data are also common in e-commerce, in which products are often described by photos and text but not with standardized sets of attributes. Whereas much is known about how to efficiently measure consumer preferences when products can be meaningfully described by structured attributes, there is scant research on doing the same for unstructured data. This paper introduces a real-time, adaptive survey design framework for measuring preferences over unstructured data, leveraging Bayesian optimization. By adaptively choosing items to display based on uncertainty around a nonparametric utility model, the proposed method maximizes information gain per question, enabling quick estimation of individual-level preferences. The approach operates on embeddings of the unstructured data, thereby eliminating the requirement for manual coding of product attributes. We apply the method to measuring preferences over clothing and highlight its potential for both the general task of marketing research and the specific task of designing customer onboarding surveys to mitigate the cold-start recommendation problem. We also develop methods for interpreting the nonparametric utility functions, which allow us to reconstruct consumer valuations of discrete attributes, even for attributes that were not considered or available a priori.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We test how effective a human–algorithm interaction is at stopping users from overdrawing their bank accounts. We use a randomized field experiment and draw our sample from users of a large personal financial management platform operating in the United States and Canada. We find that sending as-needed reminders is effective in and of itself, and the impact is intensified by the human response to the structure of the message. More simple messages are more effective, and the framing of the simplified message makes a difference. Users with medium to high annual incomes and users with fair to good credit scores are most likely to respond positively. We find that the investigated artificial intelligence solution reduces information-gathering costs and has a positive effect but is not sufficient in all cases. Those with challenging financial situations may find it harder to act upon the warning. For our analysis, we employ parametric identifications and time-to-event semiparametric analysis. Our work contributes to the literature on financial technology as advisors, human–computer interaction, limited attention, behavioral finance, and experimental finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Financial statement preparers frequently trade off the benefit of reporting biased estimates with potential penalties for misreporting. In making this trade-off, preparers often face uncertainty about potential changes to accounting standards (“standard-setting uncertainty”) that could affect the future benefits of biased reporting. Our experiment documents two novel behavioral effects of standard-setting uncertainty on preparers’ estimates. First, standard-setting uncertainty causes preparers to make less biased estimates, even though reduced bias conflicts with their financial incentives in our setting. Second, standard-setting uncertainty increases preparers’ sensitivity to measurement imprecision, which is important for high-quality financial reporting. Although standard-setting uncertainty is often criticized, our theory and results suggest that increased financial reporting quality can be an unanticipated benefit of the uncertainty that naturally arises from a measured and deliberative standard-setting process.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">When an agent receives information from a source whose accuracy might be either high or low, standard theory dictates that she update as if the source has medium accuracy. In a laboratory experiment, subjects deviate from this benchmark by reacting less to uncertain sources, especially when the sources release good news. This pattern is validated using observational data on stock price reactions to analyst earnings forecasts, where analysts with no forecast records are classified as uncertain sources. A theory of belief updating where agents are insensitive and averse to information accuracy uncertainty can explain these results.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In algorithm-augmented service contexts where workers have decision authority, they face two decisions about the algorithm: whether to follow its advice and how quickly to do so. The pressure to work quickly increases with the speed of arriving customers. In this paper, we ask the following. How do workers use algorithms to manage system loads? With a laboratory experiment, we find that superior algorithm quality and high system loads increase participants’ willingness to use their algorithm’s advice. Consequently, participants with the superior algorithm make higher-quality recommendations than those with no algorithm (participants with the inferior algorithm make slightly lower-quality recommendations than those without). However, participants do not necessarily speed up by using algorithms’ advice; their throughput times only decrease compared with the no-algorithm baseline when the system load is high and algorithm quality is superior, although participants would benefit from working faster in all treatments. This happens in part because participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment serve customers more quickly than participants in the other treatments, conditional on using the algorithm. Participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment work especially quickly in later periods as they increasingly default to their algorithm’s advice. Our findings show that algorithms can have benefits for both decision quality and speed. Quality benefits come from workers’ decision to use their algorithms’ advice, whereas speed benefits depend on workers’ algorithm use and the time they spend deliberating about their algorithm use. Ultimately, algorithm quality and system load are mutually reinforcing factors that influence both service quality and especially speed. This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study biases and the informativeness of subjective performance evaluations in an online experiment, testing the implications of a standard formal framework of rational subjective evaluations. In the experiment, subjects in the role of workers perform a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe samples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct six experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation, (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations, and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. Moreover, we use the exogenous assignment of supervisors to workers to investigate the association between supervisors’ social preferences and their rating quality. In line with the model of optimal evaluations, we find that ratings are more lenient and less informative when they determine bonus payments. Rewards for accuracy reduce leniency and can enhance informativeness. When supervisors have access to more detailed performance information, their ratings vary more with the performance signal and become more informative. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that more prosocial supervisors are systematically more lenient when their ratings affect workers’ payoffs. Instead, they are more diligent in their rating behavior, resulting in more accurate and informative performance evaluations.

Using proprietary data of retirees’ annuitization decisions, we find that small accounts are more likely to be cashed out. We use occupation information as a proxy for wealth to disentangle income from the multiple-accounts effect. We show that individuals with high expected wages are more likely to annuitize overall but less likely to annuitize their small accounts (comparing to individuals with low wages). A laboratory experiment and an online experimental survey (with a large representative sample) suggest that the composition of multiple accounts affects the annuitization rates via the decisions regarding small versus large accounts.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">A growing literature has shown that people tend to make faster decisions when choosing between two high-intensity or high-utility options than when choosing between two less-intensity or low-utility options. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms of this effect of overall value (OV) on response times (RT) remains controversial, partially due to inconsistent findings of OV effects on accuracy but also due to the lack of process-tracing studies testing this effect. Here, we set out to fill this gap by testing and modeling the influence of OV on choices, RT, and eye movements in both perceptual and preferential decisions in a preregistered eye-tracking experiment ( N = 61). Across perceptual and preferential tasks, we observed significant and consistently negative correlations between OV and RT, replicating previous work. Accuracy tended to increase with OV, reaching significance in preferential choices only. Eye-tracking analyses revealed a reduction of different gaze-related effects under high OV: a reduced tendency to choose the longer fixated option in perceptual choice and a reduced tendency to choose the last fixated option in preferential choice. Modeling these data with the attentional drift-diffusion model showed that the nonfixated option value was discounted least in the high-OV condition, confirming that higher OV might mitigate the impact of gaze on choices. Our results suggest that OV jointly affects behavior and gaze influences and offer a mechanistic account for the puzzling phenomenon that decisions between options of higher OV tend to be faster, but not less accurate.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We investigate how 3- to 5-year-old U.S. and Canadian children ( N = 189) and U.S. adults ( N = 241) balance the number of endorsements for a given option with the quality of the informants&#39; source of information when deciding which of two boxes contains the better option. When choosing between two different boxes endorsed by groups of equal sizes, both children (Experiments 1-3) and adults (Experiment 6) tend to choose boxes endorsed by informants with visual access to the boxes over informants with hearsay. However, children&#39;s choices were biased toward the larger group when the size of the group conflicted with the quality of the source of the groups&#39; information (Experiments 4 and 5), while adults more often chose the option endorsed by the group with the higher quality information (Experiment 6). Children were more likely to conform to a majority opinion when compared with both adults and to a normative computational model that endorses a group proportional to the number of independent, direct observations made by that group&#39;s informants. These findings suggest that, while adults balance the size of a majority with the quality of the informants&#39; information source, preschoolers can evaluate when groups differ in the source of their information but may assume that the presence of a majority endorsing an option is inherently informative over and above the information source group members&#39; testimony relied on.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Experience is known to be a key element involved in the modulation of face-processing abilities as manifested by the inversion effect, other-race, and other-age effects. Yet, it is unclear how exposure refines internal perceptual representations of faces to give rise to such behavioral effects. To address this issue, we investigated short- and long-term experienced stimulus history on face processing. Participants performed same-different judgments in a serial discrimination task where two consecutive faces were drawn from a distribution of morphed faces. The use of stimulus statistics was measured by testing the gravitation of representations toward the experienced mean (regression-to-the-mean), and the dynamic of the biases was tested by investigating trial-by-trial performance. Own-race and own-age faces were tested alongside other-race and other-age faces employing a within-subject design. Results demonstrated greater regression biases in other-race and other-age faces than in own-race and own-age faces. Perceptual narrowing, measured by the ability to form and use the representation of the overall mean of the nonnative faces, varied with proficiency levels, with only those with low proficiency in face recognition showing the use of overall stimulus history for other-race faces. In contrast, the use of stimulus history for other-age faces was similarly affected by statistics in the low- and high-proficiency groups. The results demonstrate that narrowing is associated with specialization levels occurring more robustly for other-race faces, for which exposure is limited during sensitive periods in development.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsThe framing effect is a highly robust phenomenon, wherein logically equivalent options (e.g., 90 % chance of winning vs. 10 % chance of losing) trigger different preferences. The Information Leakage account provides a rational interpretation of this effect by suggesting that choice of frame ‘leaks’ information to decision-makers, making the frames informationally non-equivalent. For example, decision-makers might interpret a positive frame (e.g., 90 % chance of winning) as an implicit recommendation to take a risk. In a series of six preregistered experiments (total N = 1211), we manipulated the informativeness of frames by 1) reducing the perceived freedom of a speaker to choose a frame (the Choice Limitation manipulation), and 2) varying the communication context between the speaker and the listener from collaborative to competitive (the Interest Alignment manipulation). We expected a diminished framing effect in scenarios where the leaked information conveys no useful or trustworthy cues. While the Choice Limitation manipulation occasionally attenuated the framing effect, particularly in within-subject designs, the Interest Alignment manipulation consistently led to a reduction in the framing effect in both within-subject and between-subject designs. These findings show that individuals can be adaptable and sensitive to the informational value of frames and suggest that competition prompts inferences more readily than a speaker&#39;s agency over the choice of frame. The implications of these results for rational accounts of framing effects are discussed.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 Elsevier B.V.Internalizing regularities between motor responses and stimuli is crucial for adaptive functioning. However, the influence of these regularities on attentional selection remains poorly understood. This study explored whether responses, which predict the locations of search targets, direct attention toward these associated locations, a phenomenon termed response-induced attention. The experiments consist of acquisition and test phases. In the acquisition phase, participants performed a dual task involving an identification task followed by a search task. In the identification task, participants responded to the color of an object presented at the center. Immediately after this response, a search target appeared on either the left or right side. Critically, the response for the identification target predicted a more probable location of the search target. Faster responses for search targets were observed at the response-cued location than the other location, suggesting an attentional bias toward the response-cued location. In the test phase, the colors of identification targets were changed, and the responses for the identification targets were no longer informative about the search target locations. Nevertheless, search remained faster when targets appeared at the response-cued location, suggesting that responses, not colors, guided attention. This response-induced attention effect was observed in Experiment 1, where responses predicted spatially compatible target locations, as well as in Experiments 2 and 3, where they predicted incompatible locations. Experiment 4 confirmed that the observed effects resulted from the spatial distribution of attention. These findings provide new insights into the ability to learn response-stimulus regularities for the intelligent allocation of attention, demonstrating the significant role of the motor dimension in attentional selection.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Temporal discounting refers to the tendency to discount future rewards as a function of time until receipt of rewards. The discount rate can be reduced by experimentally manipulating time framing, an example being the date/delay effect: Specifically, if time until receipt of the reward is presented as a date (e.g., August 21, 2022) rather than as a delay (e.g., 136 days), temporal discounting is reduced. While this effect has been replicated several times, its underlying cognitive mechanisms are not well understood. Therefore, we used eye tracking to examine the role of attention in the date/delay effect. Participants completed both a delay and date condition of the Monetary Choice Questionnaire, while eye movements were recorded ( N = 54). Results revealed a successful replication of the date/delay effect ( p g av = 0.48). Eye tracking showed that participants compared time attributes (relative to reward attributes) more and fixated them longer in the date compared to the delay condition. Moreover, the absolute difference in reward values of choice options was more predictive of choosing the delayed reward in the date compared to the delay condition. Finally, explorative correlations revealed a stronger date/delay effect in participants who paid more attention to time than reward attributes in the delay condition and who used a more integrative search strategy. Our findings suggest that the date manipulation causes participants to weight rewards more strongly in their decision process than in the delay condition, ultimately reducing temporal discounting. Computation of time intervals in the date condition could possibly reflect an adaptation lowering the date/delay effect. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract A simple‐rule learning trap occurs when people show suboptimal category learning due to insufficient exploration of the learning environment. By combining experimental methods and computational modeling, the current study investigated the impact of two key factors believed to play essential roles in the development of a simple‐rule learning trap: early learning experience and selective attention. Our results showed that, in a learning environment where the true category mapping was determined by conjunctions of two predictive dimensions, the likelihood of falling into a single‐dimensional learning trap increased when early learning experience involved a large loss that could be predicted from a single feature dimension. In addition, using a model‐based measurement of attention bias, we observed that early experience affected trap formation by narrowing the distribution of attention to exemplar features. These findings provide the first direct empirical evidence of how early learning experience shapes the formation of a simple‐rule learning trap, as well as a more granular understanding of the role of selective attention and its interaction with early learning experience in trap formation.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Four studies ( N = 2,524 U.S.-based adults recruited from the University of California, Berkeley, or Amazon Mechanical Turk) provide support for doubling-back aversion, a reluctance to pursue more efficient means to a goal when they entail undoing progress already made. These effects emerged in diverse contexts, both as participants physically navigated a virtual-reality world and as they completed different performance tasks. Doubling back was decomposed into two components: the deletion of progress already made and the addition to the proportion of a task that was left to complete. Each contributed independently to doubling-back aversion. These effects were robustly explained by shifts in subjective construals of both one’s past and future efforts that would result from doubling back, not by changes in perceptions of the relative length of different routes to an end state. Participants’ aversion to feeling their past efforts were a waste encouraged them to pursue less efficient means. We end by discussing how doubling-back aversion is distinct from established phenomena (e.g., the sunk-cost fallacy).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study how couples allocate retirement-saving contributions across each spouse’s account. In a new dataset covering over a million US individuals, we find retirement contributions are not allocated to the account with the highest employer match rate. This lack of coordination—which goes against the assumptions of most models of household decision-making—is common, costly, persistent over time, and cannot be explained by inertia, auto-enrollment, or simple heuristics. Complementing the administrative evidence with an online survey, we find that inefficient allocations reflect both financial mistakes as well as deliberate choices, especially when trust and commitment inside the households are weak.
