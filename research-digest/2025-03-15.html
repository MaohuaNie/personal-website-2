                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Online retail settings often present shoppers with large, complex choice sets where they need to quickly and dynamically weigh the benefits and costs of search within each web page. We build a model of information search within a web page using eye-tracking data collected during two incentive-compatible online shopping experiments, in which participants browsed the websites of two different clothing retailers (Experiments 1 and 2), as well as previously reported data from a laboratory experiment involving choices among snack food assortments (Experiment 3). Our model incorporates features that build upon recent advances in descriptive and normative models of information sampling and search in psychology and economics. First, our model captures how people decide where to look by treating eye fixations on clickable options as a series of “split-second” decisions that depend on estimates of option attractiveness and navigation effort. Second, our model assumes that the value of each option is learned via Bayesian updating. Third, the choice to end search on the web page depends on a dynamic decision threshold. Our model outperforms benchmarks that assume random search, instant learning, fixed thresholds, nonheterogeneous thresholds, and stochastic accumulator stopping rules. Explicitly modeling the sequence of eye fixation decisions results in accurate counterfactual simulations of the effects of hypothetical product orderings on search duration and quality as verified using experimental manipulation, and it can be applied flexibly to a wide range of web-page layouts. Systematic differences across experiments highlight the importance of accounting for product familiarity, choice-set size, and the role of category outside options.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">We consider a finite-horizon multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem in a Bayesian setting, for which we propose an information relaxation sampling framework. With this framework, we define an intuitive family of control policies that include Thompson sampling (TS) and the Bayesian optimal policy as endpoints. Analogous to TS, which at each decision epoch pulls an arm that is best with respect to the randomly sampled parameters, our algorithms sample entire future reward realizations and take the corresponding best action. However, this is done in the presence of “penalties” that seek to compensate for the availability of future information. We develop several novel policies and performance bounds for MAB problems that vary in terms of improving performance and increasing computational complexity between the two endpoints. Our policies can be viewed as natural generalizations of TS that simultaneously incorporate knowledge of the time horizon and explicitly consider the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We prove associated structural results on performance bounds and suboptimality gaps. Numerical experiments suggest that this new class of policies perform well, in particular, in settings where the finite time horizon introduces significant exploration-exploitation tension into the problem. Finally, inspired by the finite-horizon Gittins index, we propose an index policy that builds on our framework that particularly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in our numerical experiments.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Neuroscience shows that human brains are neurologically constrained to process small numbers linearly and large numbers logarithmically, leading to underreactions to larger numbers as their perceived difference becomes smaller. We test this hypothesis in the context of earnings announcements and find that investors respond less in the short term to earnings news for stocks with high earnings per share magnitudes, exacerbating postearnings announcement drift for these stocks. These findings are distinct from and incremental to several risk-based and behavioral explanations, attenuated by robot presence and present in a quasi-experimental design using stock splits. Our evidence suggests that number processing constraints have implications for stock price efficiency. This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Determining emergency department (ED) nurse staffing decisions to balance quality of service and staffing costs can be extremely challenging, especially when there is a high level of uncertainty in patient demand. Increasing data availability and continuing advancements in predictive analytics provide an opportunity to mitigate demand uncertainty by using demand forecasts. In this work, we study a two-stage prediction-driven staffing framework where the prediction models are integrated with the base (made weeks in advance) and surge (made nearly real-time) nurse staffing decisions in the ED. We quantify the benefit of having the ability to use the more expensive surge staffing and identify the importance of balancing demand uncertainty versus system stochasticity. We also propose a near-optimal two-stage staffing policy that is straightforward to interpret and implement. Last, we develop a unified framework that combines parameter estimation, real-time demand forecasts, and nurse staffing in the ED. High-fidelity simulation experiments for the ED demonstrate that the proposed framework has the potential to reduce annual staffing costs by 10%–16% ($2 M–$3 M) while guaranteeing timely access to care.

We model a startup owned by undiversified investors with heterogeneous capital contributions and risk preferences. A social planner runs the firm on behalf of all investors. We compare investors’ expected utility with a hypothetical first-best decentralized benchmark. The startup’s optimal investment policy is procyclical and a time-varying weighted average of shareholders’ optimal investment policies. The optimal contracts issued to investors are tailor-made, interdependent, and include equity claims resembling preferred stock with heterogeneous payout caps, leading to a complex capitalization table as more investors join the startup.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Consensus analyst target prices are widely available online at no cost to investors. In this paper, we examine how the amount of dispersion in the individual target prices comprising the consensus affects the predictive association between the consensus target price and future returns. We find that returns implied by consensus target prices and realized future returns are positively correlated when dispersion is low, but they become highly negatively correlated when dispersion is high. Further analyses suggest that the differing effect of dispersion stems from incentive-driven staleness in price targets by some analysts after bad news. As a stock performs poorly and some analysts are slow to update their target prices, dispersion increases, and the consensus target price becomes too high. This has important implications for how consensus analyst target prices should inform investment decisions. We show that a hedge strategy taking a long (short) position in stocks with the highest predicted returns among stocks with the lowest (highest) dispersion earns more than 11% annually. Finally, we show that the negative correlation between consensus-based predicted returns and future realized returns for high-dispersion stocks exists mainly for stocks with high retail interest, suggesting that unsophisticated investors are misled by inflated target prices that are available freely online.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Faces-the most common and complex stimuli in our daily lives-contain multidimensional information used to infer social attributes that guide consequential behaviors, such as deciding who to trust. Decades of research illustrates that perceptual information from faces is processed holistically. An open question, however, is whether goals might impact this perceptual process, influencing the encoding and representation of the complex social information embedded in faces. If an individual were able to factorize information so that each dimension is separately represented, it might enable flexibility. Having a goal, for example, might mean that only goal-relevant dimensions are leveraged to inform behavior. Whether people are able to build such factorized representations remains unknown, largely due to natural correlations between social attributes. We overcome these confounds using a new statistical face model that orthogonalizes perceived facial attractiveness and trustworthiness. Across three experiments (N = 249), we observe that only in some contexts can humans successfully factorize multidimensional social information. When there is a clear goal of assessing another&#39;s trustworthiness, people successfully decompose these social attributes. The more an individual factorizes, the more they entrust money to others in a subsequent trust game. However, when the goal is to assess attractiveness, irrelevant information about trustworthiness is so potent that it biases how attractive someone is perceived-a trustworthiness &quot;halo effect.&quot; In contrast, in goal-agnostic environments, we do not find any evidence of factorization; instead, people encode multidimensional social information in an entwined and holistic fashion that distorts their perceptions of social attributes.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Are application hassles, or “ordeals,” an effective way to limit public program enrollment? We provide new evidence by studying (removal of) an auto-enrollment policy for health insurance, adding an extra step to enroll. This minor ordeal has a major impact, reducing enrollment by 33 percent and differentially excluding young, healthy, and economically disadvantaged people. Using a simple model, we show adverse selection—a classic feature of insurance markets—undermines ordeals’ standard rationale of excluding low-value individuals since they are also low-cost and may not be inefficient. Our analysis illustrates why ordeals targeting is unlikely to work well in selection markets. (JEL D82, G22, H75, I13, I18)</span>
