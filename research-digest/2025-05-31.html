                  <span style="color:#374151;">Essentially every choice involves an information collection or search phase prior to a decision-making phase that culminates in a choice. To study the information collection phase within an important class of search problems and understand how it influences the final choice, we embed an analytically tractable discrete choice model in a classical model of sequential search with perfect recall. Although significant progress has been made in the theory literature in analyzing consumers’ discrete choice behavior using random utility models, discrete choice through a sequential search process has not received enough attention at least in part because of analytical intractability issues. We build on the seminal Pandora’s Problem as a model of sequential search with perfect recall and on Exponomial Choice as a model of discrete choice (with each choice specified by a deterministic or observable utility component minus a random or unobservable utility component following an exponential distribution). We derive the search path and final choice probabilities in closed form, develop all the analytical tools to optimize prices for a given assortment of products, and show that the optimal assortment must contain some number of highest-value products at optimal prices. These results enable joint optimization of assortment and prices efficiently. The structure of the solution features a distinct group of products that are priced just so they remain on the search path with higher probability. Through simulation studies, allowing us to control the ground truth, we also show that our model is competitive against the state of the art in empirical modeling of sequential search and that ignoring sequential search distorts both optimal variety and pricing decisions in an upward direction.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">We consider a sequential search over a group of similar alternatives. The individual value of an alternative contains two components: an observable utility and an idiosyncratic value. Observable utilities share an unknown population distribution, which captures the similarity across the alternatives and allows for knowledge transfer within the group. Once a decision maker encounters an alternative, its utility is revealed immediately, whereas the idiosyncratic value is unobservable and needs to be learned by sampling. The goal is to select an alternative with the highest individual value, accounting for the sampling and search costs. A novel feature of this problem is the combination of the individual and population levels of learning. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian dynamic program and characterize the optimal policy by a threshold structure. We show that it depends on the difference between the mean estimates of the current alternative and the population. It is optimal to continue sampling if the difference is between a threshold pair; otherwise, accept the current alternative if it exceeds the upper threshold, and switch to a new one if it is below the lower threshold. Other structural properties are also derived to shed light on the effects of the two levels of learning. A key insight is that more uncertainty is preferable at the individual level, but less uncertainty is preferable at the population level. Various practical variants of the problem are also considered. This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis. Funding: W. T.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">As artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become pervasive in business applications, so too have interactions between AI and humans in business processes and decision-making. A growing area of research has focused on human decision and task delegation to AI assistants. Simultaneously, extensive research on algorithm aversion—humans’ resistance to algorithm-based decision tools—has demonstrated potential barriers and issues with AI applications in business. In this paper, we test a simple strategy for mitigating algorithm aversion in the context of AI task delegation. We show that simply changing the framing of decision tasks can allay algorithm aversion. Through multiple studies, we found that participants exhibited a strong preference for human assistance over AI assistance when they were rewarded for task performance (i.e., money was gained for good performance), even when the AI had been shown to outperform the human assistant on the task. Alternatively, when we reframed the task such that the participant experienced losses for poor performance (i.e., money was taken from their endowment for poor performance), the bias for preferring human assistance was removed. Under loss framing, participants delegated the decision task to human and AI assistants at similar rates. We demonstrate this finding across tasks at differing levels of complexity and at different incentive sizes. We also provide evidence that loss framing increases situational awareness, which drives the observed effects. Our results offer useful insights on reducing algorithm aversion that extend the literature and provide actionable suggestions for practitioners and managers.

Homeowners (renters) with negative (positive) net bond positions react differently to changing inflation risks. The correlation between real bond and real stock returns emerges as the strongest inflation risk quantitatively and generates large increases in stock market demand for homeowners in a 1970s counterfactual. Higher expected inflation encourages stock market participation but affects negatively poorer households without access to that adjustment. A more negative inflation-bond return correlation pushes homeowners more into the stock market, whereas poorer renters move into money. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper explores whether investors’ personal experience with climate change affects their voting behavior on climate change–related proposals. We find that fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are significantly more likely to support climate proposals. We further show that the effect is persistent. We observe significant heterogeneity in the effect of hot temperatures, depending on firm-level climate risk, the quality of the proposals, fund investment strategy, and prior awareness of climate change. Fund managers’ personal experience with climate change matters for the outcome of climate proposals as it affects the aggregate support they receive. Fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are also more likely to divest from stocks with greater exposure to climate change. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.
