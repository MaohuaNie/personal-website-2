                  <span style="color:#374151;">Can models incorporating nontraditional, behavioral elements into the classical, expected-utility framework help explain seemingly dominated choice behavior of participants in centralized matching markets? Can they help in redesigning matching mechanisms to reduce such behavior? Investigating the widely used deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm, we answer positively, both in theory and using laboratory experiments. We use an off-the-shelf news-utility model where preferences include expectations-based reference dependence (EBRD): individuals care not only about actual consumption but also about news (relative to previously held expectations) regarding consumption. Each participant in our laboratory experiments (N = 500) plays 10 simulated large-market school-assignment problems of varying competitiveness, in one of four ([Formula: see text]) different DA variants. They vary by whether individuals submit their rankings prior to the matching process (a static implementation) or make sequential decisions (a dynamic implementation), and whether they are on the proposing or receiving side: [Formula: see text]static, dynamic[Formula: see text]student proposing, student receiving[Formula: see text]. Whereas a traditional, reference-independent model predicts the same straightforward behavior across all problems and variants, a news-utility EBRD model predicts stark differences across them. Intuitively, to avert losses from bad news, EBRD individuals may downrank, or even avoid applying to, competitive positions that, when offered to them (with certainty), they will accept. Consistent with our predictions, we find that (i) across DA variants, dynamic student receiving leads to significantly fewer deviations from straightforward behavior; (ii) across problems within the other three variants, deviations increase with problem competitiveness; and (iii) in those three variants, the specific deviations predicted by EBRD are indeed those commonly observed empirically. We discuss practical implications. This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How frequent are large disagreements in human judgment? The substantial literature relating to expert assessments of real-valued quantities and their aggregation almost universally assumes that judgment errors follow a jointly normal distribution. We investigate this question empirically using 73 data sets from four different sources that include over 169,000 estimates and forecasts. We find incontrovertible evidence for excess kurtosis: that is, of fat tails. Despite the diversity of the analyzed data, varying in how much uncertainty there is in the quantity being assessed and varying in the level of expertise and of sophistication of those making the assessments, we find surprising consistency in the frequency with which an individual judgment is in large disagreement with the consensus. Fitting a generalized normal distribution to the data, we find most estimates for the shape parameter to be between 0.9 and 1.6 (where 1 is the double-exponential distribution and 2 is the normal distribution). This has important implications, in particular for the aggregation of expert estimates and forecasts and for the construction of confidence intervals. We describe optimal Bayesian aggregation with fat tails and propose a simple average-median average heuristic that performs well for the range of empirically observed distributions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">The impact of memory on economic choices can be essential, but empirical evidence of the link between them remains scarce. This study examines whether the retrieval of memories related to economic recessions affects the changes in the bias in management forecasts. Using the 2008 financial crisis as a memory trigger and focusing on annual management earnings forecasts issued for fiscal years ending between 2002 and 2018, we find that chief executive officers (CEOs) with more long-term memories of leading through past recessions and those with more intense recent memories of the financial crisis embed greater pessimism in their forecasts after the financial crisis. These findings support the retrieved-context theory in human memory as well as the availability heuristic and the recency effect in psychology. Further analyses show that it takes about three years for the increased pessimism in management forecasts to return to the pre-crisis level, mainly for CEOs with more memories of past recessions. These findings suggest that memory retrieval may delay managers’ learning after the financial crisis. Our study offers new insights into the role that memory plays in managers’ decision making.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We employ an identification strategy for retail participation to explore the link between return momentum and investing clientele. This scheme relies on strictly enforced round-lot rules in China, which financially constrain retail investors from participating in stocks with high nominal prices. We find that there is strong momentum in high-priced stocks but no momentum on aggregate. This result supports the idea that noise trades of retail investors mask momentum, whereas other more sophisticated investors contribute to momentum. We validate this notion by showing that retail investors with small (large) portfolios are less (more) prone to participating in stocks with high nominal prices. Further, small investor participation increases and momentum weakens following splits in high-priced stocks. Finally, we find that the positive relation between nominal prices and momentum extends to a considerable majority of international markets with round-lot rules.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We examine how variations in nonfinancial terms across bonds from the same issuer, referred to as “issuer term variability” (ITV), relate to bond yield spreads, returns, and investor bases. Our findings show that ITV is positively associated with yield spreads, even after accounting for the issuer’s credit ratings and other credit risk proxies. Additionally, bonds with high ITV exhibit greater default risk but deliver lower risk-adjusted returns compared with those with low ITV. We also find that yield-seeking investors are more likely to own bonds with high ITV, and bond funds that reach for yield also tend to favor high ITV bonds. These results suggest that some investors specifically target high ITV bonds to achieve higher yields, even at the cost of lower returns. Further analysis indicates that reaching for ITV is difficult to justify as rational risk-taking by constrained investors. This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">We examine a unique experiment of anonymizing online loan applications to test whether race-blind screening procedures reduce racial disparities in consumer credit. With names on applications, minority applicants are 10% less likely to receive online loan offers and receive worse offer terms than otherwise identical majority applicants. Anonymizing applications reduces such disparities substantially. High-income minority applicants benefit more than low-income minorities. We show that the racial disparities are not driven by differences in credit demand. Overall, anonymous loan applications reduce racial disparities in access to credit by increasing lender reliance on objective credit risk measures. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Human adaptation depends on individuals strategically choosing whom to learn from. A mosaic of social learning strategies—such as copying majorities or successful others—has been identified. Influential theories conceive of these strategies as fixed heuristics, independent of experience. However, such accounts cannot explain the flexibility and individual variability prevalent in social learning. Here we advance a domain-general reward learning framework that provides a unifying mechanistic account of pivotal social learning strategies. We first formalize how individuals learn to associate social features (for example, others’ behaviour or success) with reward. Across six experiments ( n = 1,941), we show that people flexibly adjust their social learning in response to experienced rewards. Agent-based simulations further demonstrate how this learning process gives rise to key social learning strategies across a range of environments. Our findings suggest that people learn how to learn from others, enabling adaptive knowledge to spread dynamically throughout societies.</span>
