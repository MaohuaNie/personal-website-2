We elicit WTPs for risky and ambiguous lotteries and vary the timing (immediately vs. in two weeks) when the uncertainty is resolved. Subjects have lower WTPs for longshots than for safer lotteries. Under ambiguity, this gap decreases with temporal distance. Subjects are ambiguity averse, which becomes less pronounced when low-probability lotteries are processed in the future. In a trust game, we study temporal-distance effects on social risks. Time distance lowers trust as trustors correctly anticipate that reciprocity is lower when trustees decide in the future.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorThe present paper evaluates the importance of belief updating for the prevalence of the disposition effect – the reluctance to sell assets at losses as compared to gains. In particular, the present paper studies whether restricting choices in investment risk taking decisions motivates different learning from the decision outcomes and whether such differences in learning cause differences in the emergence of the disposition effect. The results show that investors learn from negative outcomes more like Bayesians if their risk-taking decisions are restricted. Causal mediation analysis reveals that such differences in learning increases the probability to sell after losses, which improves the overall investment performance. Compared to gains, the differences in learning after losses explain also why investors making active risk-taking choices are less likely to sell after losses as compared to gains, while the effect is reversed when choices are restricted. These findings suggest that restricting the discretion in decisions influences the way investors learn from decision outcomes and these differences in learning can explain puzzling differences in the risk-taking behavior of individual investors.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.Decisions on whether to engage in a pro-social act can separate altruistic from non-altruistic individuals. We explore the role of the probability that the pro-social action has to be carried out after publicly deciding in favor of it. In such a signaling environment, a lower probability that the act has to be carried out cheapens the signal. We use a model to predict how this cheapness influences decision-making behavior and the updating of beliefs about the decision-maker&#39;s level of altruism. In a laboratory experiment, we test the model&#39;s predictions by varying the probability that the pro-social decision has to be carried out and the strength of image concerns. If the image concern is non-monetary, the experimental data reveals that, in line with the model&#39;s predictions, the share of pro-social decisions increases in the case of cheaper signals. The prediction that the effect of the cheapness increases with image concerns cannot be confirmed by the data. Belief-updating is a crucial element of modeling pro-social decision-making in signaling environments, as it provides the trade-off between costs and image benefits. However, the experimental data does not show significant belief-updating differences depending on the cheapness of the signal after observing a pro-social decision.</span>

We found that when participants were given the freedom to submit any number as their final forecast after observing the one produced by the algorithm (a condition found to mitigate algorithm aversion), the average degree of reliance on high and low performing algorithms did not significantly differ when there was no practice stage. Participants relied less on the algorithm when there was practice stage, regardless of its performance level. The reliance on the low performing algorithm was positive even when participants could infer that they outperformed the algorithm. Indeed, participants would have done better without relying on the low performing algorithm at all. Our results suggest that, at least in some domains, excessive reliance on algorithms, rather than algorithm aversion, should be a concern.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Decisions with risky consequences at multiple points in time are driven not only by risk attitudes and time preferences but also by attitudes toward intertemporal correlation (i.e., the correlation between outcomes at different points in time). This paper proposes a model-free method to measure degrees of intertemporal correlation aversion. We disentangle attitudes toward positive and negative intertemporal correlation, which can differ if expected intertemporal utility is violated. In an experiment, subjects on average exhibited correlation aversion both for lotteries with positive correlation and for lotteries with negative correlation. That is, they disliked positive correlations and liked negative correlations. At the individual level, we found heterogeneity and remarkably, many subjects being insensitive to intertemporal correlations. Moreover, for most subjects, expected intertemporal utility was violated because attitudes toward positive and negative correlation differed.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">We explore the nature and robustness of the attraction effect. The attraction effect can be seen as a persistent bias or as the result of heuristics that may not persist upon reflection. We provide robust experimental evidence that the attraction effect first rises and then falls over time when participants are incentivized to make a quick choice they can later revise. Participants in two experiments under continuous time pressure make choices among options with the aim to maximize an objective, measurable value. We find that participants disproportionately favor the asymmetrically dominant option in the first seconds and then revise their choices until the effect disappears or is significantly reduced. The effect survives only in the special and often studied case of indifference among options. We develop a tractable extension to the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator model to allow for choice revisions. That model explains how choice revisions reduce context effects. We estimate its parameters at the individual level and document differences between fast and slow participants that also play a role in explaining the rise-and-fall pattern in the attraction effect. We extend the analysis to similarity and compromise effects. We find a very small similarity effect, which does not exhibit any dynamics, and a significant reverse compromise effect displaying a rise-and-fall pattern. Our findings, although limited to objective-value tasks, are consistent with context effects being short-term heuristics that can be superseded by more reflective cognitive strategies when decision makers have time and incentive to do so.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Consumers encounter costs and inconvenience in the purchase and consumption of goods. Time, effort, training, and expertise, also referred to as access costs, are examples of factors that constrain the ability of consumers to derive utility from offerings beyond the price of a good. Economies of scope exist when household production of these factors share commonalities among choice alternatives, making it more likely that some products would be purchased and consumed in conjunction with others. For example, consumers planning out-of-town travel might consider visiting multiple tourist attractions during their trip, and course offerings might appeal more to students who are already in the mindset of taking courses. We develop a model with economies of scope that captures a leveraging effect where the purchase of one good makes the purchase of other goods more likely. Our model offers an alternative explanation of complementary purchases that are driven by cost reductions rather than utility enhancements. The model is applied to four conjoint datasets where we find that economies of scope and access costs play an important role in consumer purchases and have high economic value relative to the role played by price.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Emotional involvement is known to be necessary but not sufficient for good decision making in the face of uncertainty. It has been conjectured that emotional engagement in anticipation of risky outcomes constitutes “good” emotions. We introduce a new methodology to determine whether anticipatory emotional engagement is beneficial in the context of trading in financial markets. We focus on heart rate changes because they occur at a sufficiently high frequency to discern timing relative to events in the marketplace. After conservatively adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, we find that participants whose heart rate changes anticipate their order submissions at inflated prices earn significantly more, whereas participants whose heart rate responds to their trades earn significantly less. By investigating cointegration between skin conductance response and the dynamics of individual portfolio values, we confirm the importance of emotional involvement in determining who makes or loses money.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study the introduction of robo-advising on a large set of employee saving plans. Different from many services that fully automate portfolio decisions, our robo-advisor proposes investment and rebalancing strategies, leaving investors free to follow or ignore them. The resulting human-robot interactions occur both at the time of the subscription and over time, as the robot sends alerts when the investor’s portfolio gets too far from the target allocation. We show that the robo-service is associated with an increase in investors’ attention and trading activities. Following the robot’s alerts, investors change their rebalancing behaviors so as to stay closer to their target allocation, which results in larger portfolio returns. Counterfactual returns induced by automatic rebalancing by the robot would be only slightly higher, suggesting that, on average, the financial cost of letting investors retain control is not large.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper examines whether perceptions of discrimination affect the economic expectations of U.S. households. We focus on two forms of expectations that play a central role in economic and financial decisions of households: labor income and inflation. Using experimental data, we demonstrate that discrimination generates greater dispersion in household forecasts. It increases subjective expectations of income uncertainty by 8% and inflation uncertainty by 5%. The impact of discrimination is concentrated among racial/ethnic minorities, inducing 12%–16% greater variation in their income uncertainty expectations and 10%–12% greater variation in their inflation uncertainty expectations. Both psychological and emotional factors appear to influence the discrimination–economic expectations relation. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Our prior experiences shape the way that we prioritize information from the environment for further processing, analysis, and action. We show in three experiments that this process of attentional prioritization is critically modulated by the degree of uncertainty in these previous experiences. Participants completed a visual search task in which they made a saccade to a target to earn a monetary reward. The color of a color-singleton distractor in the search array signaled the reward outcome(s) that were available, with different degrees of variance (uncertainty). Participants were never required to look at the colored distractor, and doing so would slow their response to the target. Nevertheless, across all experiments, participants were more likely to look at distractors associated with high outcome variance versus low outcome variance. This pattern was observed when all distractors had equal expected value (Experiment 1), when the difference in variance was opposed by a difference in expected value (i.e., the high-variance distractor had a low expected value, and vice versa: Experiment 2), and when high- and low-variance distractors were paired with the maximum-value outcome on an equal proportion of trials (Experiment 3). Our findings demonstrate that experience of prediction error plays a fundamental role in guiding &quot;attentional exploration,&quot; wherein priority is driven by the potential for a stimulus to reduce future uncertainty through a process of learning, as opposed to maximizing current information gain.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">People generally empathize with others and find harm aversive. Yet aggression, for example, between groups, abounds. How do people learn to overcome this aversion in order to aggress? Many models of learning emphasize outcome prediction errors-deviations from expected outcomes in the environment-but aggression may also be fueled by affective prediction errors (affective PEs)-deviations from how we expect to feel. Across five preregistered online experiments that hold outcome prediction errors constant ( N = 4,607), participants choosing aggressive or nonaggressive actions aggressed more against disliked group members and often escalated or persisted in taking actions that felt better than expected (positive affective PE), especially when those actions were aggressive. Crucially, inducing incidental empathy toward the group of the target rendered affective PE signals sensitive to group identification-participants escalated aggression that felt better than expected relatively less toward liked versus disliked group members. That said, affective PEs did not always add explanatory power beyond levels of postoutcome affect alone; we discuss the importance and implications of these results. In summary, we reveal affective PE integration as a candidate algorithm facilitating exceptions to harm aversion in intergroup conflict. More broadly, we highlight for affective science and decision-making researchers the necessity of appropriately testing separable components of affective signals in predicting subsequent behavior.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Cognitive control has been theorized operating through two distinct mechanisms, proactive and reactive control, as posited by the dual mechanism of control model. Despite its potential to explain cognitive control variability, the supporting evidence for this model remains inconclusive. Prior studies frequently employed the Stroop task to assess this model, manipulating the proportion congruency (PC) at the list-wide and/or item-specific levels to target proactive and reactive control, respectively. However, these manipulations have been questioned as they may invoke low-level associative learning instead of control-driven mechanisms. Although solutions have been proposed to address these concerns, they still have limitations and impracticalities. In pursuit of a clearer understanding of this issue, we manipulated proactive and reactive control simultaneously to more directly investigate their separability. We conducted two experiments using a peripheral and a perifoveal spatial Stroop task version, respectively, and we adopted state-of-the-art methodologies, leveraging trial-level multilevel modeling analytical approaches, to effectively estimate the Stroop effect and its control-related modulations while controlling for confounding factors. Notably, we manipulated both list-wide and item-specific PCs at the trial level, allowing for a fine-grained analysis. Our results provide compelling evidence for the existence of a list-wide, PC-dependent proactive control mechanism, influencing Stroop performance independently of reactive control and confounding factors. Additionally, an item-specific PC-dependent reactive control effect was found to influence Stroop performance only in interaction with proactive control. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between proactive and reactive control mechanisms, shedding light on the intricate nature of cognitive control.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier Inc.How do people adapt to others in adversarial settings? Prior work has shown that people often violate rational models of adversarial decision-making in repeated interactions. In particular, in mixed strategy equilibrium (MSE) games, where optimal action selection entails choosing moves randomly, people often do not play randomly, but instead try to outwit their opponents. However, little is known about the adaptive reasoning that underlies these deviations from random behavior. Here, we examine strategic decision-making across repeated rounds of rock, paper, scissors, a well-known MSE game. In experiment 1, participants were paired with bot opponents that exhibited distinct stable move patterns, allowing us to identify the bounds of the complexity of opponent behavior that people can detect and adapt to. In experiment 2, bot opponents instead exploited stable patterns in the human participants’ moves, providing a symmetrical bound on the complexity of patterns people can revise in their own behavior. Across both experiments, people exhibited a robust and flexible attention to transition patterns from one move to the next, exploiting these patterns in opponents and modifying them strategically in their own moves. However, their adaptive reasoning showed strong limitations with respect to more sophisticated patterns. Together, results provide a precise and consistent account of the surprisingly limited scope of people&#39;s adaptive decision-making in this setting.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier Inc.Human judgments of similarity and difference are sometimes asymmetrical, with the former being more sensitive than the latter to relational overlap, but the theoretical basis for this asymmetry remains unclear. We test an explanation based on the type of information used to make these judgments (relations versus features) and the comparison process itself (similarity versus difference). We propose that asymmetries arise from two aspects of cognitive complexity that impact judgments of similarity and difference: processing relations between entities is more cognitively demanding than processing features of individual entities, and comparisons assessing difference are more cognitively complex than those assessing similarity. In Experiment 1 we tested this hypothesis for both verbal comparisons between word pairs, and visual comparisons between sets of geometric shapes. Participants were asked to select one of two options that was either more similar to or more different from a standard. On unambiguous trials, one option was unambiguously more similar to the standard; on ambiguous trials, one option was more featurally similar to the standard, whereas the other was more relationally similar. Given the higher cognitive complexity of processing relations and of assessing difference, we predicted that detecting relational difference would be particularly demanding. We found that participants (1) had more difficulty detecting relational difference than they did relational similarity on unambiguous trials, and (2) tended to emphasize relational information more when judging similarity than when judging difference on ambiguous trials. The latter finding was replicated using more complex story stimuli (Experiment 2). We showed that this pattern can be captured by a computational model of comparison that weights relational information more heavily for similarity than for difference judgments.</span>

Given a true signal distribution, we deem one bias more harmful than another if it yields lower objective expected payoffs in all decision problems. We characterize this ranking in static and dynamic settings. While the static characterization compares posteriors signal by signal, the dynamic characterization employs an “efficiency index” measuring how fast beliefs converge. We quantify and compare the severity of several well-documented biases. We also highlight disagreements between the static and dynamic rankings, and that some “large” biases dynamically outperform other “vanishingly small” biases. (JEL D60, D82, D83, D91)</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2023A key element of human flexible behavior concerns the ability to continuously predict and prepare for sudden changes in tasks or actions. Here, we tested whether people can dynamically modulate task preparation processes and decision-making strategies when the identity of a to-be-performed task becomes uncertain. To this end, we developed a new paradigm where participants need to prepare for one of nine tasks on each trial. Crucially, in some blocks, the task being prepared could suddenly shift to a different task after a longer cue-target interval, by changing either the stimulus category or categorization rule that defined the initial task. We found that participants were able to dynamically modulate task preparation in the face of this task uncertainty. A second experiment shows that these changes in behavior were not simply a function of decreasing task expectancy, but rather of increasing switch expectancy. Finally, in the third and fourth experiment, we demonstrate that these dynamic modulations can be applied in a compositional manner, depending on whether either only the stimulus category or categorization rule would be expected to change.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The Author(s)How do people decide between maintaining information in short-term memory or offloading it to external reminders? How does this affect subsequent memory? This article presents a simple computational model based on two principles: A) items stored in brain-based memory occupy its limited capacity, generating an opportunity cost; B) reminders incur a small physical-action cost, but capacity is effectively unlimited. These costs are balanced against the value of remembering, which determines the optimal strategy. Simulations reproduce many empirical findings, including: 1) preferential offloading of high-value items; 2) increased offloading at higher memory loads; 3) offloading can cause forgetting of offloaded items (‘Google effect’) but 4) improved memory for other items (‘saving-enhanced memory’); 5) reduced saving-enhanced-memory effect when reminders are unreliable; 6) influence of item-value: people may preferentially offload high-value items and store additional low-value items in brain-based memory; 7) greatest sensitivity to the effort of reminder-setting at intermediate rather than highest/lowest levels of task difficulty; 8) increased offloading in individuals with poorer memory ability. Therefore, value-based decision-making provides a simple unifying account of many cognitive offloading phenomena. These results are consistent with an opportunity-cost model of cognitive effort, which can explain why internal memory feels effortful but reminders do not.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsAdults expect people to be biased by sunk costs, but young children do not. We tested between two accounts for why children overlook the sunk cost bias. On one account, children do not see sunk costs as causal. The other account posits that children see sunk costs as causal, but unlike adults, think future actions cannot make up for sunk costs. These accounts make opposing predictions about whether children should see sunk costs as affecting emotions. Across three experiments, 4–7-year-olds (total N = 320) and adults (total N = 429) saw stories about characters who collected items that were easy or difficult to obtain, and predicted characters&#39; emotions and actions. At all ages, participants anticipated that characters would feel sadder about high-cost objects, but only adults predicted that characters would keep high-cost objects. Our findings show that children see incurred costs as causal, and that costs are integrated children&#39;s and adults&#39; theory of emotions. Moreover, the findings suggest that developmental differences in sunk cost reasoning may rest in children&#39;s incomplete mental accounting. We also discuss children&#39;s reasoning about rational and irrational action.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024A prevailing argument posits that distal landmarks dominate over proximal landmarks as orientation cues. However, no studies have tested this argument or examined the underlying mechanisms. This project aimed to close this gap by examining the roles of relative cue precision and prior knowledge in cue preference. Participants learned object locations with proximal and distal landmarks in an immersive virtual environment. After walking a path without seeing objects or landmarks, participants disoriented themselves by spinning in place and pointed to the objects with the reappearance of a proximal landmark being rotated −50°, a distal landmark being rotated 50°, or both (Conflict). Heading errors were examined. Experiment 1 manipulated the relative cue precision. Results showed that in Conflict condition, the observed weight on the distal cue (exceeding 0.5) changed with but remained higher than the weight predicted by the relative cue precision. This indicates that besides the relative cue precision, prior knowledge of distal cue dominance also influences orientation cue usage. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants walked a path stopping at one object location. Participants were informed of it explicitly in Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 3. Results showed that distal cue dominance still occurred in Experiment 3. However, in Experiment 2, proximal cue dominance appeared, and it was not predicted by the relative cue precision. These results suggest that prior knowledge of proximal cue dominance might have been invoked by the instruction of locations. Consistent with the Bayesian inference model, human cue usage in orientation is determined by relative cue precision and prior knowledge. The choice of prior knowledge can be influenced by instructions.</span>

More specifically, we show that the exponential discounting model can be rewritten to a specific case of the VARMAX, thereby shedding light on the underlying similarities and assumptions of the two models. This derivation has some important consequences for research. First, it allows researchers who use discounting models in their studies to use the tools established within the broader time series literature to evaluate the applicability of their models. Second, it lays bare some of the implicit restrictions discounting models put on their parameters and, therefore, provides a foundation for empirical testing and validation of these models. One of these restrictions concerns the exponential shape of the discounting function that is often assumed in the affect dynamical literature. As an alternative, we briefly introduce the quasi-hyperbolic discounting function.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The Author(s)We propose an extension of the widely used class of multinomial processing tree models by incorporating response times via diffusion-model kernels. Multinomial processing tree models are models of categorical data in terms of a number of cognitive and guessing processes estimating the probabilities with which each process outcome occurs. The new method allows one to estimate completion times of each process along with outcome probability and thereby provides process-oriented accounts of accuracy and latency data in all domains in which multinomial processing tree models have been applied. Furthermore, the new models are implemented hierarchically so that individual differences are explicitly accounted for and do not bias the population-level estimates. The new approach overcomes a number of shortcomings of previous extensions of multinomial models to incorporate response times. We evaluate the new method&#39;s performance via a recovery study and simulation-based calibration. The method allows one to test hypotheses about processing architecture, and it provides an extension of traditional diffusion model analyses where multinomial models have been proposed for the modeled paradigm. We illustrate these and other benefits of the new model class using five existing data sets from recognition memory.</span>
