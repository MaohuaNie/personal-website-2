                  <span style="color:#374151;">Motivated by the successes of deep learning, we propose a class of neural network–based discrete choice models, called RUMnets, inspired by the random utility maximization (RUM) framework. This model formulates the agents’ random utility function using a sample average approximation. We show that RUMnets sharply approximate the class of RUM discrete choice models: Any model derived from random utility maximization has choice probabilities that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a RUMnet. Reciprocally, any RUMnet is consistent with the RUM principle. Our approach is closely related to ranking-based models and mixtures of multinomial logits proposed in previous literature in a more general contextual setting. We derive an upper bound on the generalization error of RUMnets fitted on choice data and provide theoretical insights on their ability to predict choices on new unseen data depending on critical parameters of the data set and architecture. The models are estimated by leveraging open-source libraries for training neural networks. We find that RUMnets are competitive against several choice modeling and machine learning methods in terms of predictive accuracy on two real-world data sets. We also conduct synthetic experiments that isolate the effects of each architecture component. This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science. Funding: A.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We examine the additivity of expectations over different time intervals. For example, when asked about 10-year stock price growth, survey respondents report an expected change that is not equal to, but closer to zero than, the sum of their expectations over two shorter time intervals that cover the same 10 years. Such subadditivity, which we also find in expectations for other economic variables, is irrational, as it cannot stem from aggregating short-term expectations. Model estimates show that the pattern is consistent with a time perception where shorter time intervals have a proportionally larger weight. We also find that the respondents’ degree of additivity is correlated with making larger financial investments. This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We recover forward-looking expected net-of-fee abnormal returns (alphas) for active equity mutual funds from analyst ratings. In contrast to the typical equilibrium implication of zero alphas, analyst alphas are negative for most funds, but positive for the largest funds. We compare analysts’ subjective expectations with expectations from a rational expectations learning model. The model’s rational learner believes that an increase in fund size leads to a decrease in returns, but we find no evidence that analysts believe so. Consistently, counterfactual ratings based on the rational model tend to outperform analysts’ ratings out of sample. Investor fund flows respond significantly to analyst ratings.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study a supply chain distribution system and investigate experimentally operations of markets where retailers can trade digital claims (tokens) on the supplier’s capacity. Subjects play the role of retailers, have heterogeneous valuations of goods, face random demands, and buy tokens on the supplier’s capacity. Following demand realization, retailers trade tokens with each other in markets implemented as double-sided, single-price, blind, batch auctions. We compare six behavioral treatments, featuring two wholesale prices and three market sizes. As expected, markets reduce leftovers and shortages. Interestingly, market-clearing prices are anchored to wholesale prices and do not signal the value of goods in large markets. Players deploy novel ordering and trading strategies that differ from the transshipment literature. We identify strategies by applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In one strategy, players buy a few claims and, after demand realization, use the market to satisfy it. Other players buy more claims than the maximum demand and, once demand is known, sell their excess on the market. Both strategies reduce costs from demand uncertainty but expose players to liquidity and mistakes risks. A third strategy, in which players order from the supplier initially as if expecting the market to be cleared cooperatively, is more profitable. This strategy diversifies demand and market risks. The introduction of markets causes the “pull-to-the-mean” effect and increases order variability. Thus, markets can cause the Bullwhip Effect. Retailers’ and the supply chain’s average profits are higher with markets, but suppliers with low wholesale prices suffer from lower revenues because of the pull-to-the-mean effect.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study household finance in the age of FinTech, where digital payments are integrated with various financial services through all-in-one super apps. We hypothesize that increased FinTech adoption via digital payments can lower the nonmonetary costs (e.g., psychological barriers) associated with financial market participation. We find that higher FinTech adoption leads to greater participation and increased risk taking in mutual fund investments. Using distance from Ant as an instrument for FinTech penetration, as well as the exogenous penetration of QRPay in Shenzhen, we further provide causal evidence from digital payment to risky fund investment. Moreover, the effect of FinTech is stronger among individuals who are otherwise more constrained, those with higher risk tolerance, or those living in under-banked counties.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">I examine why the prices that consumers pay influence their ratings of products. In the context of hotel reviews on an online booking platform, I find that prices have larger impact on ratings when consumers face larger uncertainty about hotel quality, indicating that prices affect satisfaction through consumers’ quality expectation. On the other hand, I find that the mere fact that the reviewer received higher surplus through a lower price by itself is not a primary reason for a higher rating. I also present suggestive evidence of consumer reciprocation, in which consumers experiencing a high-quality staff service likely become more forgiving of higher prices. I show that introductory pricing can have a substantial impact on the distribution of review rankings among new entrants because of the role of prices as quality signals. Understanding the price effect on ratings is crucial to designing review systems robust to potential distortion. This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We show that migration induced by the COVID-19 pandemic significantly predicts changes in municipal bond yields. Negative migration shocks have made debt more expensive, especially in the areas and bonds most exposed to the work-from-home (WFH) transition. Over the full sample, a one-standard-deviation increase in COVID period out-migration predicts an approximate 4.5-basis-point rise in municipal bond yields, after controlling for a range of local economic factors including state- or core-based statistical area (CBSA)-year fixed effects. This effect is 40% larger for areas in the top decile of WFH exposure and approximately twice as large for transportation-backed bonds. Moreover, areas containing the most exposed bonds (i.e., those with out-migration and high WFH exposure) also experience relatively large post-COVID declines in municipal revenue. Overall, our results suggest that investors have changed their estimates of the level or uncertainty of municipalities’ future cash flows, especially for areas and bonds most exposed to the transition toward remote work.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We unveil asset managers’ social media communications as a distinct new channel for attracting flows of money to mutual funds. Combining a database of more than 1.6 million posts on X/Twitter by U.S. mutual fund families with textual analysis, we find that flows of money to mutual funds respond positively to both the number and tone of the posts. Whereas the link between social media communications and flows of money is not explained by conventional marketing efforts, our findings suggest that the social media channel is not independent from asset management companies’ broader marketing strategies. A high-frequency analysis that exploits intraday ETF trade data allows us to isolate the effect of tweets on investor decisions from potential confounders. We then consider and test four different economic mechanisms. The results of these tests do not support the hypothesis that asset managers’ social media communications reduce search costs for potential investors. The results do not support, either, that asset management companies’ Twitter activity increases investor attention or alleviates information asymmetries by communicating performance-relevant information to investors. In contrast, our evidence suggests that asset managers use social media as an effective persuasion tool. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have had tremendous success accounting for reward-based learning across species, including instrumental learning in contextual bandit tasks, and they capture variance in brain signals. However, reward-based learning in humans recruits multiple processes, including memory and choice perseveration; their contributions can easily be mistakenly attributed to RL computations. Here I investigate how much of reward-based learning behaviour is supported by RL computations in a context where other processes can be factored out. Reanalysis and computational modelling of 7 datasets ( n = 594) in diverse samples show that in this instrumental context, reward-based learning is best explained by a combination of a fast working-memory-based process and a slower habit-like associative process, neither of which can be interpreted as a standard RL-like algorithm on its own. My results raise important questions for the interpretation of RL algorithms as capturing a meaningful process across brain and behaviour.</span>
