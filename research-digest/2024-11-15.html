                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Most theories of decision making under risk assume that payoffs and probabilities are separable. In the context of a lottery, the subjective value of a prospective outcome (the payoff) is assumed to be independent of the likelihood that the outcome will occur (the probability). In violation of this assumption, we present eight experiments showing that people anticipate less utility from uncertain outcomes than from certain outcomes, even conditional on their realization. The devaluation of uncertain outcomes is observed across different measures of utility (willingness to spend money or time; choice between different options), different populations (student and online samples), and different manipulations of uncertainty. We show that this result does not simply reflect a misunderstanding of the instructions or people’s aversion toward a “weird” transaction with unexplained features. We highlight the implications of this phenomenon for empirical investigations of risk preferences and conclude with a discussion of the psychological mechanisms that might drive the devaluation of probabilistic outcomes.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Overconfidence is pervasive in subjective probability distributions (SPDs). We develop new methods to analyze judgments that entail both a distribution of possible outcomes in a population (aleatory uncertainty) and imperfect knowledge about that distribution (epistemic uncertainty). In four experiments, we examine the extent to which subjective probability mass is concentrated in a small portion of the distribution versus spread across all possible outcomes. We find that although SPDs roughly match the concentration of the empirical, aleatory distributions, people’s judgments are consistently overconfident because they fail to spread out probability mass to account for their own epistemic uncertainty about the location and shape of the distribution. Although people are aware of this lack of knowledge, they do not appropriately incorporate it into their SPDs. Our results offer new insights into the causes of overconfidence and shed light on potential ways to address this fundamental bias.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Revealed preferences between alternatives can be systematically reversed across a variety of elicitation procedures (e.g., choice, valuation, matching, joint/separate evaluation). These puzzling findings have been usually invoked to challenge the procedure invariance principle. Yet procedure-dependent preferences can be endogenous. This paper presents a unifying theory of contextual deliberation to account for seemingly disparate phenomena of preference reversals. When attribute importance is ex ante imperfectly known, people can engage in costly information retrieval/acquisition activities (i.e., deliberation) prior to making decisions. Elicitation procedures can influence revealed preferences through affecting the incentive for deliberation. Therefore, contextual deliberation can endogenously yield procedure-dependent preference reversals, offer a common microfoundation for extant psychological accounts (e.g., the prominence hypothesis, the evaluability hypothesis), and coherently organize apparently unrelated/inconsistent findings in the literature. We also run five experiments and document new findings that are inconsistent with extant hypotheses but can be reconciled by contextual deliberation.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Consumers increasingly use digital advice when making purchasing decisions. How do such tools change consumer behavior and what types of consumers are likely to use them? We examine these questions with a randomized controlled trial of digital expert advice in the context of prescription drug insurance. The intervention we study was effective at changing consumer choices. We propose that, conceptually, expert advice can affect consumer choices through two distinct channels: by updating consumer beliefs about product features (learning) and by influencing how much consumers value product features (interpretation). Using our trial data to estimate a model of consumer demand, we find that both channels are quantitatively important. Digital expert advice tools not only provide consumers with information, but also alter how consumers value product features. For example, consumers are willing to pay 14% less for a plan with the most popular brand and 37% less for an extra star rating when they incorporate digital expert advice on plan choice relative to only having information about product features. Further, we document substantial selection into the use of digital advice on two margins. Consumers who are inherently less active shoppers and those who we predict would have responded to advice more were less likely to demand it. Our results raise concerns regarding the ability of digital advice to alter consumer preferences as well as the distributional implications of greater access to digital expert advice.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We introduce a measure of regret for stock market investors and investigate its cross-sectional asset pricing implications. According to our regret-based framework, investors experience regret due to not achieving the highest possible return from a similar set of stock investments, and equity portfolios with high regret generate 6.84% more annualized alpha than portfolios with low regret. Using investor-trading activity of 78,000 households at a large U.S.-based brokerage firm, we develop an investor-based regret index and show that this household-level regret measure predicts stock returns in a similar way to our proposed regret measure. We also show that regret is not spanned by established risk or behavioral factors that have been documented to be robust predictors of equity returns. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper studies the impact of betrayal aversion on employees’ effort provision in exchange for a bonus payment that is at the employers’ expense and discretion. In our first study, using a laboratory experiment, we find that the performance of an employee with average betrayal aversion is lower by more than 15% relative to betrayal-neutral employees. Inspired by the findings, we theoretically identify a tradeoff for the effort provision of betrayal-averse employees. That is, higher effort not only increases the level of betrayal when the bonus is not paid, but it also increases the chances to receive a bonus avoiding betrayal. In a second study, we confirm our findings in an online labor market. The data also find support for the identified tradeoff. In a third study, we manipulate employees’ beliefs about the chances of receiving the bonus to provide causal evidence for the tradeoff.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Moral rules come with exceptions, and moral judgments come with uncertainty. For instance, stealing is wrong and generally punished. Yet, it could be the case that the thief is stealing food for their family. Such information about the thief&#39;s context could flip admonishment to praise. To varying degrees, this type of uncertainty regarding the context of another person&#39;s behavior is ever‐present in moral judgment. Hence, we propose a model of how people evaluate others’ behavior: We argue that individuals principally judge the righteousness of another person&#39;s behavior by assessing the likelihood that they would act the same way if they were in the person&#39;s shoes. That is, if you see another person steal, you will consider the contexts where you too would steal and assess the likelihood that any of these contexts are true, given the available information. This idea can be formalized as a Bayesian model that treats moral judgment as probabilistic reasoning. We tested this model across four studies ( N = 601) involving either fictional moral vignettes or economic games. The studies yielded converging evidence showing that the proposed model better predicts moral judgment under uncertainty than traditional theories that emphasize social norms or perceived harm/utility. Overall, the present studies support a new model of moral judgment with the potential to unite research on social judgment, decision‐making, and probabilistic reasoning. Beyond this specific model, the present studies also more generally speak to how individuals parse uncertainty by integrating across different possibilities.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Inferring an individual&#39;s preferences from their observable behavior is a key step in the development of assistive decision‐making technology. Although machine learning models such as neural networks could in principle be deployed toward this inference, a large amount of data is required to train such models. Here, we present an approach in which a cognitive model generates simulated data to augment limited human data. Using these data, we train a neural network to invert the model, making it possible to infer preferences from behavior. We show how this approach can be used to infer the value that people assign to food items from their eye movements when choosing between those items. We demonstrate first that neural networks can infer the latent preferences used by the model to generate simulated fixations, and second that simulated data can be beneficial in pretraining a network for predicting human‐reported preferences from real fixations. Compared to inferring preferences from choice alone, this approach confers a slight improvement in predicting preferences and also allows prediction to take place prior to the choice being made. Overall, our results suggest that using a combination of neural networks and model‐simulated training data is a promising approach for developing technology that infers human preferences.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Recent studies using the diffusion decision model find that performance across many cognitive control tasks can be largely attributed to a task‐general efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA) factor that reflects individuals’ ability to selectively gather evidence relevant to task goals. However, estimates of EEA from an n‐back “conflict recognition” paradigm in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development SM (ABCD) Study, a large, diverse sample of youth, appear to contradict these findings. EEA estimates from “lure” trials—which present stimuli that are familiar (i.e., presented previously) but do not meet formal criteria for being a target—show inconsistent relations with EEA estimates from other trials and display atypical v‐shaped bivariate distributions, suggesting many individuals are responding based largely on stimulus familiarity rather than goal‐relevant stimulus features. We present a new formal model of evidence integration in conflict recognition tasks that distinguishes individuals’ EEA for goal‐relevant evidence from their use of goal‐irrelevant familiarity. We then investigate developmental, cognitive, and clinical correlates of these novel parameters. Parameters for EEA and goal‐irrelevant familiarity‐based processing showed strong correlations across levels of n‐back load, suggesting they are task‐general dimensions that influence individuals’ performance regardless of working memory demands. Only EEA showed large, robust developmental differences in the ABCD sample and an independent age‐diverse sample. EEA also exhibited higher test‐retest reliability and uniquely meaningful associations with clinically relevant dimensions. These findings establish a principled modeling framework for characterizing conflict recognition mechanisms and have several broader implications for research on individual and developmental differences in cognitive control.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Violations of transitive preference can be accounted for by both the noncompensatory lexicographic semiorder heuristic and the compensatory additive difference model. However, the two have not been directly compared. Here, we fully develop a simplified additive difference (SAD) model, which includes a graphical analysis of precisely which parameter values are consistent with adherence to, or violation of, transitive preference, as specified by weak stochastic transitivity (WST) and triangle inequalities (TI). The model is compatible with compensatory, within-dimension evaluation. We also develop a stochastic difference threshold model that also predicts intransitive preferences and encompasses a stochastic lexicographic semiorder model. We apply frequentist methods to compare the goodness of fit of both of these models to Tversky&#39;s (1969) data and four replications and Bayes factor methods to determine the strength of evidence for each model. We find that the two methods of analysis converge and that, for two thirds of the participants for whom predictions can be made, one of these models predicting violations of WST has a good and the best fit and has strong Bayesian support relative to an encompassing model. Furthermore, for about 20% of all participants, the SAD model (consistent with violations of WST or TI) is significantly better-fitting and has stronger Bayesian support than the stochastic difference threshold model. Finally, Bayes factor analysis finds strong evidence against transitive models for most participants for whom the SAD model consistent with violation of WST or TI is strongly supported.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Memory theories distinguish between item and associative information, which are engaged by different tasks: item recognition uses item information to decide whether an event occurred in a particular context; associative recognition uses associative information to decide whether two events occurred together. Associative recognition is slower and less accurate than item recognition, suggesting that item and associative information may be represented in different forms and retrieved using different processes. Instead, I show how a dynamic model (Cox &amp; Criss, 2020; Cox &amp; Shiffrin, 2017) accounts for accuracy and response time distributions in both item and associative recognition with the same set of representations and processes. Item and associative information are both represented as vectors of features. Item and associative recognition both depend on comparing traces in memory with probes of memory in which item and associative features gradually accumulate. Associative features are slower to accumulate, but largely because they emerge from conjunctions of already-accumulated item features. I apply the model to data from 453 participants, each of whom performed an item and performed associative recognition following identical study conditions (Cox et al., 2018). Comparisons among restricted versions of the model show that its account of associative feature formation, coupled with limits on the rate at which features accumulate from multiple items, explains how and why the dynamics of associative recognition differ from those of item recognition even while both tasks rely on the same underlying representations.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024Despite proportional information being ubiquitous, there is not a standard account of proportional reasoning. Part of the difficulty is that there are several apparent contradictions: in some contexts, proportion is easy and privileged, while in others it is difficult and ignored. One possibility is that although we see similarities across tasks requiring proportional reasoning, people approach them with different strategies. We test this hypothesis by implementing strategies computationally and quantitatively comparing them with Bayesian tools, using data from continuous (e.g., pie chart) and discrete (e.g., dots) stimuli and preschoolers, 2nd and 5th graders, and adults. Overall, people&#39;s comparisons of highly regular and continuous proportion are better fit by proportion strategy models, but comparisons of discrete proportion are better fit by a numerator comparison model. These systematic differences in strategies suggest that there is not a single, simple explanation for behavior in terms of success or failure, but rather a variety of possible strategies that may be chosen in different contexts.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.Predictions and estimates are sometimes qualified as certain. This epistemic marker occupies a privileged position at the top of scales of verbal probability expressions, reflecting probabilities close to 1. But such statements have rarely been compared to plain, unqualified statements in which certainty is not mentioned. We examined in nine studies (N = 2784) whether statements explicitly claimed to be certain are perceived as (1) more (or less) credible, (2) more (or less) precise, and (3) more (or less) strongly based upon evidence, compared to plain, unmarked declarative statements. We find, in apparent contrast with assumptions made by the standard scales, that “certain” are often judged to be less trustworthy, less reliable, and held with lower confidence than unmarked statements. Plain, declarative statements are further assumed to be more precise, while certainty implies that more extreme outcomes are possible. When it is certain that Henry made four errors, it is clear he did not commit less than four, but he might have committed five errors or more. Thus certainty can indicate lower bounds of an interval whose upper bounds are not defined, and certainty statements are consequently more ambiguous than estimates that do not mention certainty. At least-interpretations of certainty affect the interpretation of options in risky choice problems, where “200 lives will be saved” was deemed by a majority to mean exactly 200, while “it is certain that 200 will be saved”, could mean 200–600 lives. We also find that credibility is affected by type of certainty, with impersonal certainty (“it is certain”) perceived to be more accurate and persuasive than personal certainty (“I am certain”), especially in predictions of future events. Moreover, mentions of certainty can reveal that that a speaker&#39;s estimate is based on subjective judgments and guesswork rather than upon objective evidence. These findings have implications for communication. Estimates can appear more consensual when claims of certainty are omitted. To convey certainty it may be better not to mention that one is certain.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024A severity effect has previously been documented, whereby numerical translations of verbal probability expressions are higher for severe outcomes than for non-severe outcomes. Recent work has additionally shown the same effect in the opposite direction (translating numerical probabilities into words). Here, we aimed to test whether these effects lead to an escalation of subjective probabilities across a communication chain. In four ‘communication chain’ studies, participants at each communication stage either translated a verbal probability expression into a number, or a number into a verbal expression (where the probability to be translated was yoked to a previous participant). Across these four studies, we found a general Probability Escalation Effect, whereby subjective probabilities increased with subsequent communications for severe, non-severe and positive events. Having ruled out some alternative explanations, we propose that the most likely explanation is in terms of communications directing attention towards an event&#39;s occurrence. Probability estimates of focal outcomes increase across communication stages.</span>

With empirical support in four studies, the authors shed light on how numeracy relates to tendencies to weight absolute and relative differences, depending on the type of task at hand. The authors find that numeracy can reduce the influence of absolute differences for some tasks but increase their influence for others. Additionally, sensitivity to relative differences increases for some tasks but not others.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study how misperceptions of others’ tastes influence beliefs, demand, and prices in markets with observational learning. Consumers infer a good’s quality from the quantity demanded and price paid by others. When consumers exaggerate the similarity between their and others’ tastes, such “taste projection” generates discrepant quality perceptions, which are decreasing in a projector’s taste and increasing in the observed price. These biased inferences produce an excessively elastic market demand. We also analyze dynamic monopoly pricing with short-lived taste-projecting consumers. Optimal pricing follows a declining path: a high initial price inflates future buyers’ perceptions, and lower subsequent prices induce overadoption. (JEL D42, D83, D91, L15)</span>
