                  <span style="color:#374151;">We examine how investors’ investment judgments are jointly affected by two important linguistic features that vary considerably across firms’ risk factor disclosures: namely, causal focus—the extent to which managers’ disclosures focus on the causes versus consequences of risk events—and specificity, which refers to specific references to names of objects and quantitative values. Results of controlled experiments show that, when the disclosure focus is on risk causes, greater specificity increases investment willingness because of enhanced feelings of knowable uncertainty in a risk event. In contrast, when the focus is on risk consequences, greater specificity reduces investment willingness because of diminished feelings of knowable uncertainty. Contrary to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s positive view of specific risk factor disclosures, our results suggest that specificity can have an opposite effects on investors’ judgments depending on the causal focus of risk factor disclosures.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">The value derived from hedonic goods is affected by reference effects at the time of consumption, usually in the form of quality standards. Consumption typically involves two steps: First, the consumer chooses a given good, among a pool of available choices; then, the consumer experiences the good and derives a satisfaction from it. Between both steps, consumers might build expectations about the good that might affect the ultimate realized utility. We investigate the role of quality references in this two-stage (choice-outcome) process. We develop a flexible framework for estimating quality references and their effect in choice and outcome that can include consumers’ own past experiences, as well as that of others, and can give salience to more recent or more distant past experiences. Using novel longitudinal data from online restaurant reviews, we find evidence of quality loss aversion in the choice decision stage in accordance with prospect theory. However, in the outcome stage, we do find evidence of the opposite to loss aversion, that is, satisfaction is affected much less than one would expect when going to a lower quality restaurant. This is consistent with consumers adjusting their expectations downward and suggests that expectation adjustment protects consumers when they experience a good of lower-than-reference quality. Our results challenge the implicit assumption made by most recommendation systems that the expectation building process after making a choice does not change the outcome and imply that it may be better to patronize activities by alternating between high- and low-quality choices.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Amid ongoing policy and managerial debates on keeping humans in the loop of artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making processes, we investigate whether human involvement in AI-based service production benefits downstream consumers. Partnering with a large savings bank in Europe, we produced pure AI and human–AI collaborative investment advice, which we passed to the bank customers and investigated the degree of their advice taking in a field experiment. On the production side, contrary to concerns that humans might inefficiently override AI output, our findings show that having a human banker in the loop of AI-based financial advisory by giving her the final say over the advice provided does not compromise the quality of the advice. More importantly, on the consumption side, we find that the bank customers are more likely to align their final investment decisions with advice from the human–AI collaboration, compared with pure AI, especially when facing more risky investments. In our setting, this increased reliance on human–AI collaborative advice leads to higher material welfare for consumers. Additional analyses from the field experiment along with an online controlled experiment indicate that the persuasive efficacy of human–AI collaborative advice cannot be attributed to consumers’ belief in increased advice quality resulting from complementarities between human and AI capabilities. Instead, the consumption-side benefits of human involvement in the AI-based service largely stem from human involvement serving as a peripheral cue that enhances the affective appeal of the advice. Our findings indicate that regulations and guidelines should adopt a consumer-centric approach by fostering environments where human capabilities and AI systems can synergize effectively to benefit consumers while safeguarding consumer welfare. These nuanced insights are crucial for managers who face decisions about offering pure AI versus human–AI collaborative services and also for regulators advocating for having humans in the loop.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Bargaining breakdown is common in bargaining in environments with incomplete information. We study whether, in these environments, permitting communication impacts bargaining outcomes. On May 23, 2016, eBay Germany’s Best Offer platform introduced unstructured communication allowing desktop users, but not mobile users, to accompany offers with a message. Using this natural experiment, our difference-in-differences approach documents a 14% decrease in the rate of breakdown among compliers. Though adoption is immediate, the effect is not. We show, using text analysis, that the dynamics are consistent with repeat players learning how to use communication in bargaining. Finally, tying the two results together, we show that messages that emulate the text content of experienced sellers are more likely to be accepted.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">A prominent explanation for the proliferation of political misinformation and the growing belief polarization is that people engage in motivated reasoning to affirm their ideology and to protect their political identities. An alternative explanation is that people seek the truth but use partisanship as a heuristic to discern credible from dubious sources of political information. In three experiments, we test these competing explanations in a dynamic setting where participants are repeatedly exposed to messages from ingroup or outgroup partisan sources and can learn which source is reliable based on external feedback. Participants initially showed a partisan bias as they incorporated information from ingroup sources more than from outgroup sources. This pattern was stronger among partisans that displayed high affective polarization. With experience, this partisan bias declined or even changed direction, as supporters of both groups gradually incorporated information from reliable sources more than unreliable sources irrespective of the source&#39;s partisanship. Importantly, the content of the shared information (i.e., neutral vs. political), the presence of partisan sources as opposed to neutral sources and the presence of external monetary accuracy incentives did not affect the learning process indicating the presence of strong internal accuracy motives. In contrast, increased uncertainty regarding source reliability undermined the learning process. These findings demonstrate that partisans follow Bayesian learning dynamics. Although participants initially display a partisan bias in the incorporation of information, they overcome this bias in the presence of external feedback and learn to trust credible sources irrespective of partisanship.
