                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Traditional models of rational choice assume that preferences are complete, but the completeness axiom is neither normatively compelling nor psychologically plausible. Building on recent work in economics, we develop a rational analysis of decision making with incomplete preferences. The analysis sheds surprising light on a range of well-known behavioral &quot;anomalies,&quot; including the endowment effect, status quo maintenance, the sunk cost effect, and coherent arbitrariness. We propose a two-part division of rational choice theory-into preference theory and &quot;implementation theory&quot;-and show how conservative and coherently arbitrary policies can effectively implement incomplete preferences. The two-part normative framework motivates a psychological distinction between evaluation and implementation phases in decision making. We argue that the endowment effect and related phenomena, which have usually been attributed to loss aversion in the evaluation phase, are better explained by conservatism in the implementation phase. The rational analysis challenges the normative adequacy of expected utility theory and raises questions about the explanatory scope of prospect theory. It illustrates the rich interplay between psychological models of value structure and normative models of rational choice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">What are the risky choices people face in our complex and fast-changing world? This article reports on a series of population surveys in Switzerland ( N = 4,380) that collected those risky choices that are relevant in people’s everyday lives. Using this empirical basis, we developed an inventory consisting of 100 unique real-life choices to address open questions regarding the structure, life domains, and stability of the current ecology of risk. Moreover, a follow-up study ( N = 933) indicated some degree of generalizability of the construct of risk preference to the newly identified real-life choices. The five key insights that emerged from our analyses may be useful for researchers studying decision-making under risk and uncertainty (e.g., what criteria to use when developing novel measurement instruments) and policymaking in applied settings (e.g., addressing how swiftly the risks of modern life change).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Companies pursue their goals by selecting and implementing a combination or portfolio of actions that consume resources. The extent to which these actions help attain the companies’ objectives is often contingent on whether a given future scenario is realized. In this paper, we present a model-based framework for supporting the selection of a portfolio of actions that is robust across different scenarios while accounting for the impacts that the actions may have on the probabilities of these scenarios. For the purposes of this framework, we develop a new portfolio decision analytic model and algorithms to help generate recommendations for selecting actions, when (i) the actions’ scenario- and objective-specific impacts, as well as preferences between the objectives are incompletely specified, and (ii) information regarding scenario probabilities is incomplete and may depend on the selected actions. Finally, we provide a comprehensive report on the application of the framework in a high-impact case on supporting the strategy process at the payments unit of Nordea Bank Abp, the largest retail bank in the Nordic countries. Based on retrospective interviews with the participants in this strategy process, three kinds of impacts from the use of our framework could be identified: (i) actions related to implementing the decision recommendations and strengthening the required capabilities, (ii) information to help evaluate these decision recommendations as the future unfolded, and (iii) behavioral changes in terms of elevating the level of strategic discussions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How are asset price volatility and liquidity impacted by public perception of the economic state and by market competitivity? We wish to understand the direct impacts as well as indirect impacts via information acquisition and aggregation. To investigate, we design a laboratory experiment with human subjects as bond investors and exogenously vary the bond default rate, the private information cost schedule, and the market format. To discipline the experiment parameters and to obtain hypotheses for empirical testing, we construct a theoretical model that closely parallels the experiment. We find that the laboratory data support most theoretical predictions, for example, liquidity increases when traders purchase more precise private information, when public information indicates a less ominous state, and when the market is less competitive. Overall price volatility also increases with more precise private information and less competitivity, but it decreases with less ominous public information. Decomposing volatility into “efficient” and “inefficient” components may offer insight for policy analysis. This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Despite economic setbacks, managers may resist exiting to avoid harming employees who will lose their jobs. We propose that managers with higher prosocial preferences set lower exit thresholds and select conservative investments that reduce the risk of having to exit because they experience stronger feelings of anticipatory guilt. Our field study shows that, in responding to intensifying Chinese import competition, prosocial managers are less likely to exit or divest. Our experiments (N = 1,411), including a sample of senior executives, show that anticipatory guilt mediates the negative effect of prosocial preferences on exit thresholds and risky investments. Anticipatory guilt and its effect are stronger when employees suffer greater harm from the firm’s exit due to the absence of social insurance programs, such as public health insurance or unemployment insurance. Our study presents an emotion-processual account of firm exit decisions and highlights anticipatory guilt as an emotional barrier to efficient decision-making.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Although clinical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can augment medical diagnosis decisions by providing competent second opinions, how to effectively integrate AI into routine diagnostic processes, such as when to present AI advice to human physicians, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our research experimentally examines how the timing of AI advice affects diagnostic decision making using a think-aloud approach. Physicians perform medical diagnoses under three conditions: ex post advice (AI advice given after an initial diagnosis), ex ante advice (AI advice given concurrently with clinical information), and a control condition (no AI advice). Our results indicate that the timing of AI advice significantly affects diagnostic accuracy and calibration, with the ex post advice condition yielding the best performance and the control condition the worst. We then conduct several analyses to disentangle the underlying mechanism. We reveal that the superior diagnostic quality in the ex post advice condition can be attributed to more thorough clinical information processing and more active cognitive engagement with AI’s reasoning rationale. As a result, participants in the ex post advice condition are more capable of differentiating correct from incorrect AI advice than those in the ex ante advice condition. Additionally, they benefit more from high-quality AI advice that contradicts their initial diagnoses. To gain additional insights, we estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects based on physician and clinical case characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of presenting AI advice at appropriate times during routine diagnostic processes to achieve successful decision augmentation with AI advice.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Prior research in social psychology has shown that when people feel anxious, they seek advice from others. Yet, companies that operate in high-anxiety settings (like financial services, healthcare, and education) are increasingly deploying self-service technologies (SSTs), through which anxious customers transact without access to human contact. These companies may therefore face a classic efficiency–service trade-off where gains in operational efficiency through automation also hamper service outcomes by neglecting customer anxiety. This paper, set in the high-anxiety domain of financial services, investigates the value of facilitating access to human contact during SST usage. In a field experiment conducted within the context of a credit union’s SST loan-approval process, an invitation to connect with a human loan agent increases the customer uptake rate of approved loans by 24%. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments, which explicitly investigate the linkages among anxiety, choice satisfaction, and firm trust during SST encounters show that compared with participants without anxiety, those who are anxious consistently report lower satisfaction with their choices and less trust in the firm, regardless of the source of their anxiety. When anxiety is related to the SST encounter, facilitating access to human contact dampens anxiety’s negative effects on choice satisfaction and, by extension, increases firm trust. We further observe that these benefits of facilitating access to human contact arise even though very few customers choose to access a person. Taken together, this research reveals an opportunity for firms to maintain operational efficiency in high-anxiety self-service settings without compromising customer experiences and service outcomes.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Users are now typically able to access historical data in traffic, restaurant, and retailing contexts. This availability of information can be viewed as a means to reduce congestion. However, scientific support for this notion is weak. We investigate, using a laboratory experiment, whether an intermediate level of information provision might reduce congestion. We also study how the effect of making more information available changes over time. We show that providing all users with information is counterproductive in the short run. In the long run, users’ behavior adjusts so that providing some or all individuals with information leads to more efficient outcomes than when no information is made available. Small Sample models capture a number of the patterns in the data, in particular the switching behavior between routes. The data show that making congestion information available to all parties reduces efficiency early on but is beneficial in the long run.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Central bank liquidity backstops and bank leverage regulation interact across financial intermediaries and states of the world. A backstop is implemented only in some states to grease the wheels of bank dealers that absorb fire sales. It also incentivizes asset managers to take on excessive redemption risk. Regulation binds in other states, in which it hamstrings market making. Because this outcome increases asset managers’ fire sale costs, it reins in their risk-taking. Empirically, we confirm such a disciplining effect of regulation on U.S. money market funds. Theoretically, we derive that the two policy measures complement each other in raising social welfare because they address different sources of redemption-driven losses—fire sale costs for given risk-taking and excessive risk-taking, respectively.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Decision-making processes and risk-taking are prominent for coping in both, but the implications for guaranteed and probabilistic reward discounting, important components in behavioural decision-making processes, are unclear. This study explored the relationships between PTSD and suicide risk with tendencies towards devaluing guaranteed rewards that are larger but delayed (i.e., delay discounting; DD) and devaluing larger but uncertain rewards (i.e., probability discounting; PD) for immediate but smaller rewards. The current study evaluated 498 participants (majority male [51.4%] and white [63.8%]; 33.3% screening positive for probable PTSD; 19.2% with lifetime suicide attempts; 30.8% with recent suicide ideation) on both delayed discounting and PD tasks. Provisional PTSD diagnosis, but not suicide attempts or ideation, was associated with increased PD (i.e., more devaluation of uncertain rewards). Conversely, PTSD interacted with both attempt history and ideation to predict increased delayed discounting (i.e., more devaluing of greater but delayed rewards). These results highlight how those with PTSD symptoms assign valuations to rewards, as well as how the addition of suicide risk interacts to impact these decision-making processes. While further research is needed, this suggests potential implications for treatment as they may benefit from structuring progress in smaller, more immediate goals.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Exposure to adversity may impair executive functioning (EF; i.e., deficit frameworks), but could also enhance, or leave intact, specific EF abilities (i.e., adaptation frameworks). Both frameworks often use raw performance (e.g., speed) to estimate EF ability. However, this approach (a) conflates different cognitive processes and (b) generally does not distinguish specific EF abilities from processes that are shared across EF tasks, such as general processing speed. Here, we integrate deficit and adaptation frameworks by building bridges with mathematical and cognitive psychology. Specifically, we use cognitive modeling (drift diffusion modeling) to isolate different cognitive processes: speed of information accumulation, response caution, and speed of stimulus encoding and response execution. We then use structural equation modeling to investigate whether associations between adversity and cognitive processes are task-general or ability-specific. We recruited 1,061 participants from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel. Participants completed a basic processing speed task, two inhibition tasks, and three attention-shifting tasks. We measured self-reported exposure to threat and material deprivation in childhood and adulthood. Exposure to threat (but not deprivation) in adulthood was negatively associated with task-general processing speed. After accounting for task-general processes, the remaining variance was not related to either inhibition or attention-shifting ability. Nonpreregistered analyses showed that childhood exposure to deprivation and threat was negatively associated with (a) general processing speed and (b) task-specific information accumulation. The latter reflected unique features of individual tasks, rather than specific EF abilities. Taken together, these results suggest that adversity researchers may overestimate associations between adversity and specific EF abilities when analyzing raw performance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Daily life, whether at home or at work, requires people to split their attention. These simultaneous demands can be exhausting, and one strategy is to reallocate attention toward a pressing demand at the expense of others. Choosing how to allocate limited cognitive resources is the basis of many psychological theories, but few have directly investigated the cognitive mechanism that drives the resource allocation process. In this article, we present a novel joint-computational approach that highlights the central role of attentional resource allocation in dual-task environments. We present two paired experiments where participants simultaneously complete a Multiple Object Tracking task alongside a Detection Response Task. In breaking with previous modeling investigations, our computational framework unites separate decision-making models under the control of a single allocation process that makes accurate predictions under a range of cognitive demands. Foremost, the current investigation provides a framework for quantifying the subjective and latent processes involved in divided attention. We discuss the theoretical implications of our approach and highlight the flexibility of decision-makers to adjust where resources are spent under dynamically shifting workloads.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Older adults are known to share more political misinformation than younger adults, but the nature of this tendency remains unclear. Using signal detection theory, this research examines two explanations for older adults&#39; greater political misinformation sharing: (a) Age reduces people&#39;s ability to discriminate true from false information, leading older people to share more misinformation, and (b) older people exhibit stronger partisan sharing, preferring to share information that is congruent with their political ingroup rather than the outgroup. Two exploratory studies around the 2022 presidential elections in Brazil and midterm elections in the United States (NBrazil = 697; NU.S. = 1,716) support the partisan congruence explanation. Age does not robustly predict discernment between true versus false information in sharing intentions or accuracy judgments. Instead, age predicts partisan biases in sharing political news and judging its accuracy, and these effects remain after controlling for income and education. The effects of age in predicting partisan information sharing are not statistically mediated by measures of cognitive reflection, need for cognition, or faith in intuition. These results suggest that older adults engage in more partisan information assessment and sharing behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract From building a new piece of furniture to replacing a lightbulb, people must often figure out how to assemble an object from its parts. Although these physical assembly problems take on many different forms, they also pose common challenges. Chief among these is the question of how to break a complex problem down into subproblems that are easier to solve. What principles determine why some strategies for decomposing a problem are favored over others? Here, we investigate the decisions that people make when considering different visual subgoals in the context of attempting to build a series of virtual block towers. We hypothesized that people favor subgoals achieving a balance between how much progress the subgoals would help achieve toward the final goal and how effortful they would be to solve. We tested this hypothesis by defining several computational models of planning and subgoal selection, then evaluating how well these models predicted human planning and subgoal selection behavior on the same problems. Our results suggest that participants rapidly differentiated the computational costs of otherwise similarly ambitious subgoals, and used these judgments to drive subgoal selection. Moreover, our findings are consistent with the possibility that participants were not only sensitive to the immediate computational costs associated with solving the very next subgoal, but also future costs that might be incurred when attempting the rest of the problem. Taken together, these results contribute to our understanding of how humans make efficient use of cognitive resources to solve complex, grounded planning problems.</span>

Cognitive scientists have developed Bayesian Network models of how people integrate perceptions of source credibility when learning from information provided by sources, but these models do not involve the crucial source characteristic in politics: bias. Biased sources make claims that align with a particular political agenda, whether or not they are true. We present a novel Bayesian Network model which integrates perceptions of a source&#39;s bias as well as their expertise. We demonstrate the model&#39;s validity for predicting how people will update beliefs and perceptions of bias and expertise in response to testimony across two studies, the second being a preregistered conceptual replication and extension of the first.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Using data from over 100 US retirement plans and a representative UK panel, I document the impact of auto-enrollment (AE) on retirement savings at different horizons. I replicate the impact of AE on participation and contributions in the short run (at 12 months), but I show that these gains are attenuated over the medium run (at 36 months). At this longer horizon, the average savings increases are modest, though AE significantly lowers inequality in savings. To assess AE’s lifetime impact, I estimate a life cycle consumption-savings model that can fit the observed patterns with a switching cost of approximately $250, smaller than previous estimates.

              <p style='margin:0 0 12px;font-size:14px;color:#374151;line-height:1.6;'>The paper investigates the perceived cost of cognitive effort and factors that influence it, addressing how effort costs shape decision making and resource allocation. This has implications for understanding choice behavior under demanding tasks and could inform computational models of effort-based decisions.</p>
