                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsHallmark phenomena of risky choice, such as risk aversion and deviations from expected value (EV) maximization, are commonly modeled with psychoeconomic curves (e.g., utility function, probability weighting function). Yet these functions describe choices rather than the cognitive processes that generate them. Here, we examine how aspects of the oft-neglected process of information search – in particular, switching between options during sampling and stopping based on sampled evidence – can give rise to patterns in experience-based risky choice in the context of the sampling paradigm. We develop a computational framework that conceptualizes sampling strategies as consisting of three building blocks: a search rule (governing the rate of switching between options during sampling), a comparison rule (roundwise vs. summary evaluation of the options), and a stopping rule (decision threshold). In simulation analyses comparing different combinations of these building blocks, we show that frequent switching increases EV-maximizing choices for strategies with a summary comparison rule, but decreases maximization for strategies with a roundwise comparison rule. Further, frequent switching promotes an apparent underweighting of rarely experienced events found under the roundwise comparison rule, and curtails overweighting found under the summary comparison rule. We also reveal how the sampling strategies give rise to different risk attitudes depending on the existence and attractiveness of rare events. Finally, an empirical analysis suggests that people combine switching behavior and comparison rules in a way that fosters EV-maximizing choices. Our results underscore the possible contribution of search processes to patterns in risky choice.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsHow do people judge the temporal order and simultaneity/successiveness of events? Three candidate models can explain the theoretically constraining shapes of the psychometric functions observed in tasks with more complex response formats. First, the response-error model allows that internal states generated by a triggered-moments process are misreported due to finger errors, requiring that psychometric functions are parallel after empirically accounting for finger errors (parallelism) and that successiveness perception is necessary for temporal-order perception (necessity). Second, the two-stage model posits that two independent and serial processes generate simultaneity/successiveness and temporal-order judgments, requiring that temporal-order judgment accuracy does not depend on simultaneity/successiveness judgment accuracy (independence) and that simultaneity responses are not slower than order responses (seriality). Third, the two-threshold model formalizes the idea that the order threshold can be higher than the successiveness threshold, requiring necessity and that the order threshold is not lower than the successiveness threshold (threshold inequality). Five experiments evaluated these model assumptions against precise individual data collected with audio-visual and visual stimuli in temporal-order judgment, simultaneity judgment, ternary-response, and dual-response tasks. The response-error model was invalidated by near-universal violations of parallelism in 63/64 tests, and the two-stage model by consistent violations of independence (20/20) and predominant violations of seriality (30/44). By contrast, the threshold inequality in the two-threshold model was satisfied in 39/40 tests, whereas necessity was violated in 10/20 tests. Joint model fits across the four tasks also revealed that the two-threshold model provides the best general account of temporal judgment. We conclude that the two-threshold model is the least inadequate of the three candidate models, and consider a generalized two-threshold model with fluctuating criteria to address violations of necessity.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Traditional models of rational choice assume that preferences are complete, but the completeness axiom is neither normatively compelling nor psychologically plausible. Building on recent work in economics, we develop a rational analysis of decision making with incomplete preferences. The analysis sheds surprising light on a range of well-known behavioral &quot;anomalies,&quot; including the endowment effect, status quo maintenance, the sunk cost effect, and coherent arbitrariness. We propose a two-part division of rational choice theory-into preference theory and &quot;implementation theory&quot;-and show how conservative and coherently arbitrary policies can effectively implement incomplete preferences. The two-part normative framework motivates a psychological distinction between evaluation and implementation phases in decision making. We argue that the endowment effect and related phenomena, which have usually been attributed to loss aversion in the evaluation phase, are better explained by conservatism in the implementation phase. The rational analysis challenges the normative adequacy of expected utility theory and raises questions about the explanatory scope of prospect theory. It illustrates the rich interplay between psychological models of value structure and normative models of rational choice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Everyday decision making often involves choosing between multiple alternatives, and developing unified theories for this process would benefit broad disciplines of behavioral science. A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that arise specifically in multialternative decisions. This study, based on preregistered procedures, investigated such nonnormative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a &quot;max versus next&quot; decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally accounted for a well-known nonnormative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multichoice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by identifying two critical time windows in confidence constructions: Confidence is based on sensory evidence collected shortly after stimulus presentation and evidence gathered right after decision making. These findings represent a significant advancement in understanding the dynamics underlying multichoice irrationalities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Utilitarian ethical theories argue that the morality of actions depends on their consequences for impartially maximizing overall welfare. Recent research suggests that individual differences in utilitarian tendencies fall along two dimensions: a permissive attitude toward harming others for greater good (instrumental harm [IH]) and an impartial concern for others&#39; welfare (impartial beneficence [IB]). We hypothesize that these dimensions operate as intuitive theories in the moral domain, framing distinctive patterns of moral judgments and behavior. Using intersubject representational similarity analysis of behavioral data (N = 254), we found that when participants shared endorsement of instrumental harm or impartial beneficence, they showed similar patterns of moral judgment and decision making. Intersubject representational similarity analysis of functional neuroimaging data (N = 68) revealed that participants with similar endorsement of instrumental harm or impartial beneficence showed similar neural encoding of moral choice attributes, even when they made different choices. Meanwhile, participants with dissimilar endorsement of these dimensions showed distinctive neural encoding of moral choice attributes, even when they made similar choices. These similarity and dissimilarity patterns emerged in distinct brain regions for instrumental harm and impartial beneficence. Together, our findings suggest that instrumental harm and impartial beneficence distinctively frame cognitive representations of moral decision problems, over and above guiding judgments and decisions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">People hold their opinions and evaluations of objects with varying degrees of certainty. Understanding the nature of evaluation certainty is important, as it is a strong predictor of behavior. Several factors that impact certainty have been identified in past research, including value positivity, value extremity, and consistency in value-relevant evidence. However, whether these factors contribute uniquely to certainty or are statistically confounded remains unknown. The present work discusses four experiments (total N = 372) to disentangle these factors by leveraging the phenomenon of ensemble perception. We created pairs of ensembles (food baskets and retail good bundles) that are experimentally equalized on value positivity, value extremity, or evidence consistency, while systematically varying in evaluation certainty or evidence consistency. The results show independent contributions of value positivity and value extremity, but not evidence consistency, on ensemble evaluation certainty. Neither of the equalized factors fully accounts for evaluation certainty in the created ensembles, suggesting that it is a complex construct influenced by multiple independent factors.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Exposure to adversity may impair executive functioning (EF; i.e., deficit frameworks), but could also enhance, or leave intact, specific EF abilities (i.e., adaptation frameworks). Both frameworks often use raw performance (e.g., speed) to estimate EF ability. However, this approach (a) conflates different cognitive processes and (b) generally does not distinguish specific EF abilities from processes that are shared across EF tasks, such as general processing speed. Here, we integrate deficit and adaptation frameworks by building bridges with mathematical and cognitive psychology. Specifically, we use cognitive modeling (drift diffusion modeling) to isolate different cognitive processes: speed of information accumulation, response caution, and speed of stimulus encoding and response execution. We then use structural equation modeling to investigate whether associations between adversity and cognitive processes are task-general or ability-specific. We recruited 1,061 participants from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel. Participants completed a basic processing speed task, two inhibition tasks, and three attention-shifting tasks. We measured self-reported exposure to threat and material deprivation in childhood and adulthood. Exposure to threat (but not deprivation) in adulthood was negatively associated with task-general processing speed. After accounting for task-general processes, the remaining variance was not related to either inhibition or attention-shifting ability. Nonpreregistered analyses showed that childhood exposure to deprivation and threat was negatively associated with (a) general processing speed and (b) task-specific information accumulation. The latter reflected unique features of individual tasks, rather than specific EF abilities. Taken together, these results suggest that adversity researchers may overestimate associations between adversity and specific EF abilities when analyzing raw performance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Daily life, whether at home or at work, requires people to split their attention. These simultaneous demands can be exhausting, and one strategy is to reallocate attention toward a pressing demand at the expense of others. Choosing how to allocate limited cognitive resources is the basis of many psychological theories, but few have directly investigated the cognitive mechanism that drives the resource allocation process. In this article, we present a novel joint-computational approach that highlights the central role of attentional resource allocation in dual-task environments. We present two paired experiments where participants simultaneously complete a Multiple Object Tracking task alongside a Detection Response Task. In breaking with previous modeling investigations, our computational framework unites separate decision-making models under the control of a single allocation process that makes accurate predictions under a range of cognitive demands. Foremost, the current investigation provides a framework for quantifying the subjective and latent processes involved in divided attention. We discuss the theoretical implications of our approach and highlight the flexibility of decision-makers to adjust where resources are spent under dynamically shifting workloads.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Human information sampling undergoes fundamental changes during development: Young children sample broadly, whereas adults attend selectively to goal-relevant information. The mechanisms driving these differences remain unclear. Previous explanations-inhibition failure, noisy processing, and information-seeking-cannot fully account for the empirical data. We test an alternative hypothesis that broad information sampling may stem from working memory constraints limiting children&#39;s ability to maintain internal attentional maps that guide sampling decisions. In three experiments, we examined how taxing working memory through a dual-task paradigm affects adults&#39; information sampling in decision making and category learning. Adults under working memory load shifted their sampling patterns toward those observed in young children-successful task performance coupled with broad exploration and distributed attention. Notably, computational modeling revealed that these adults, like children, remembered supposedly irrelevant information better than selective attention models predicted, demonstrating broader information encoding rather than generalized task impairment. These findings provide causal evidence for working memory&#39;s role in shaping information sampling across development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Humans learn adaptive behaviors via a durable but incremental reinforcement learning (RL) system and a fast but fleeting working memory (WM) system. Past work parsing these systems focused on reward learning alone; hence, little is known about how they interact while simultaneously learning to avoid punishment and whether arbitrating between these demands is disrupted by psychiatric symptoms. We administered a novel reward/punishment RL-WM task to an online sample oversampled for depression and anxiety symptoms ( N = 298; n = 275 after quality control). Participants avoided punishment during initial learning, yet poorly retained this avoidance. Computational modeling captured this pattern via the fleeting WM system facilitating punishment avoidance, while the durable RL system retained little about punishment. Our task also included two test phases interleaved with learning, which permitted a targeted examination of past findings that WM blunts the RL system. When RL-based retention was tested midway through learning, we indeed found evidence of blunting. Yet, after learning resumed-leading to further prediction errors-blunting was no longer evident in a final test phase. However, individual differences moderated this effect: Some individuals were especially susceptible to blunting; for others, WM actually facilitated retention. Finally, task performance was largely spared as a function of depression/anxiety and trait rumination. Overall, our findings demonstrate that-when seeking to attain reward and avoid punishment concurrently-the WM system can facilitate short-term punishment avoidance while the RL system retains little about punishment, reveal individual differences in the extent to which WM blunts RL, and demonstrate intact behavior under internalizing-disorder symptoms.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Group stereotypes are difficult to change and drive discriminatory behavior across numerous consequential contexts. Across seven experiments, we test predictions made by a domain-general structure learning model to understand how people decide what &quot;counts&quot; as a group and how those group representations inform our beliefs-here, stereotypes about what a group believes-about constituent members. We have two central hypotheses. First, given low levels of deviance within a collective, participants will perceive a single group among all agents; however, as deviance of one &quot;counter-stereotypical&quot; agent increases, that agent will be subtyped out of the group, yielding two perceived clusters. Second, as deviance increases, confidence in one&#39;s beliefs about the group and, correspondingly, a novel group member should decrease; however, once the deviating agent is subtyped out, confidence in one&#39;s beliefs about the remaining agents and novel member should increase again. We found consistent evidence for the first prediction: As one agent&#39;s deviation from the group increased from 0% to 25%, the deviant was subgrouped . As deviation increased to 50% and more, the deviant was subtyped out of the group. We only observed support for the second prediction in two of the experiments using the confidence measure. However, an exploratory analysis of these experiments revealed a new way to index group stereotype precision-quantifying perceived similarity of all the nondeviating agents to one another. Using this measure of group-based beliefs, we see support for our second hypothesis in a majority of the experiments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 Elsevier B.V.Verbal probability is categorized into two types in terms of directionality: positive (suggesting the occurrence of a target outcome: e.g., “it is likely”) or negative (suggesting the nonoccurrence: e.g., “it is quite uncertain”). Previous studies have shown that people&#39;s decisions are affected by differences in directionality, and that they use either positive or negative expressions depending on the communicative situation. In this study, we attempt to clarify the relationship between decisions and communicative behavior based on verbal probabilities. We proposed a quantitative model called Decision by Belief Sampling based on the Decision by Sampling model and the reference point hypothesis, and examined whether decisions and communicative behaviors could be explained with this model. The proposed model reveals the psychological mechanisms underlying superficially unrelated phenomena between decisions and communicative behaviors. In particular, listeners of verbal probabilities (decision-makers) infer the beliefs held by a speaker (conveyer of information) and make decisions based on these beliefs. These inferred beliefs align with the speaker&#39;s beliefs when communicating probabilistic information. Thus, the proposed model clarifies the psychological link between decisions affected by directionality and communicative behaviors (speaker&#39;s choice of directionality).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsPrior research shows that when people try to think of things, such as solutions to a problem, the options that come to mind most often are those that they consider statistically common and valuable. Here, we ask whether ordinary people anticipate this and, therefore, infer that when uncommon solutions come to someone&#39;s mind, it is diagnostic of how much those solutions are represented as valuable—including in the moral domain. To illustrate, imagine your friend is brainstorming what to serve a vegetarian couple and says aloud, “maybe pizza, salad, or penne alfredo?” While some of the options can be explained by both their value and statistical frequency (e.g., pizza or salad), you might infer that only your friend&#39;s particular affection for penne alfredo explains why that option came to mind. Across four studies we demonstrate inferences of this kind, and our results suggest that participants are able to make such inferences by inverting their intuitive understanding of the option-generation process itself. Whereas many current models of our folk theory of mind focus on the core mechanics of deliberative choice – such as the use of beliefs and desires to plan rational action – our results show a much broader folk understanding of pre-deliberative aspects of thought, such as the very process of option generation.</span>

These findings challenged the causal pluralism account proposed by Lombrozo (2010) but ultimately supported its core insight: namely, that reasoners think about causal scenarios in terms of both process and dependency. Quillien et al. (2025) provided a compelling re-analysis of Thanawala and Erb&#39;s data, arguing that more sophisticated counterfactual accounts of causal reasoning (a type of dependency theory) can account for temporal order effects without appealing to causal pluralism. Here, we question whether continuing to frame the literature in terms of an opposition between process and dependency theories is the most productive path forward. We contend that investigations of causal reasoning would benefit from (1) occasionally emphasizing rich empirical exploration over strict theory comparison and (2) developing integrative accounts to capture how factors typically associated with either process or dependency theories jointly support causal reasoning.</span>

Thus, this game can be used to both demonstrate and study the cognitive phenomena of visual search asymmetry and task switching. The commercial format generated more fun and produced faster reaction times than the ‘experiment-like’ format, demonstrating the importance of surface characteristics. The original version of Ghost Blitz (where Task B was more frequent) was rated as less fun than an inversed version (where Task A was more frequent), highlighting the importance of structural characteristics. This surprising result was explained via multiple regression, where the frequency with which players experience accuracy loss during Task B to Task A switching predicted the reduction in self-reported fun. By meeting people where they are, games allow the public to have increased connection with psychological theory and enable the empirical validation of choices made during commercial game design.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsOne main cornerstone of adaptive behavior is belief updating, whereby new and unexpected observations lead to the updating of learned associations between events, behaviors and outcomes. This process necessitates the detection of changed environmental contingencies which in turn leads to uncertainty about the environmental regularities. Change and uncertainty are thus inherently linked, and both constructs have been linked to pupil size changes, which might reflect activity in neural networks underlying belief updating. Thus, in our study, we aimed to disentangle the effects of change and uncertainty on pupil-linked arousal. We used a probabilistic reversal learning task, where participants had to act according to changing preferences of a fictional character, and used specific cues to independently manipulate the level of change and uncertainty (e.g. the fictional character winked for signaling change, or his face was blushed to indicate uncertainty). We found that when the cues triggered the same amount of uncertainty, larger levels of change in beliefs led to a transient increase in pupil size during cue processing. In contrast, when the cues signaled a similar amount of change, then increased belief uncertainty was associated with a sustained increase in pupil size, extending in time beyond cue processing. Thus, change and uncertainty exerted independent influence on pupil-linked arousal, possibly reflecting the activity of different neural networks, and highlighting the need to disentangle the effects of these overlapping but distinct theoretical constructs.</span>

The action sequence can become a “chunk” when individual actions are grouped together and executed as one unit, making them more efficient to store and execute. While chunking has been studied extensively across various domains, a puzzle remains as to why and under what conditions action chunking occurs. To tackle these questions, we develop a model of conditional policy compression—the reduction in cognitive cost by conditioning on an additional source of information—to explain the origin of chunking. We argue that chunking is a result of optimizing the trade-off between reward and conditional policy complexity. Chunking compresses policies when there is temporal structure in the environment that can be leveraged for action selection, reducing the amount of memory necessary to encode the policy. We experimentally confirm our model&#39;s predictions, showing that chunking reduces conditional policy complexity and reaction times. Chunking also increases with working memory load, consistent with the hypothesis that the degree of policy compression scales with the scarcity of cognitive resources. Finally, chunking also reduces overall working memory load, freeing cognitive resources for the benefit of other, not-chunked information.</span>

The present study investigated the mechanism of post-conflict control involved in the CSE by measuring the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the Simon task with computer-mouse tracking. To examine control-specific CSEs driven by response conflict, a confound-minimized design was employed, rigorously controlling for stimulus repetitions, response repetitions, contingency learning, and response errors. We presented horizontal and vertical Simon tasks, each with two distinct stimulus and response alternatives, in a trial-to-trial interchanging order. Participants responded by moving a mouse cursor from the screen center to a target response box, determined by stimulus color rather than its location. Dynamic features of spatial precision and movement speed, as well as discrete movement latency and spatial features, were analyzed. Beyond the typical Simon effect, we identified post-conflict slowing and selective suppression of task-irrelevant response activation as two distinguishable modes of post-conflict control that manifest in different movement features and processing stages. This suggests that the CSE likely arises from two sub-processes of post-conflict control, rather than a unitary mechanism.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How are asset price volatility and liquidity impacted by public perception of the economic state and by market competitivity? We wish to understand the direct impacts as well as indirect impacts via information acquisition and aggregation. To investigate, we design a laboratory experiment with human subjects as bond investors and exogenously vary the bond default rate, the private information cost schedule, and the market format. To discipline the experiment parameters and to obtain hypotheses for empirical testing, we construct a theoretical model that closely parallels the experiment. We find that the laboratory data support most theoretical predictions, for example, liquidity increases when traders purchase more precise private information, when public information indicates a less ominous state, and when the market is less competitive. Overall price volatility also increases with more precise private information and less competitivity, but it decreases with less ominous public information. Decomposing volatility into “efficient” and “inefficient” components may offer insight for policy analysis. This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

Households extrapolate from improvements in financial situation, but deteriorations are associated with an increased dispersion of forecasts, and higher probabilities of both negative and positive forecast errors. Individuals who expect earnings declines to revert too quickly save less and are more likely to be financially worse off again in the future. Learning from past errors reduces the likelihood that individuals are optimistic following a deterioration in their finances. The evidence shows how experiences, learning, and life events matter for expectation formation. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Despite economic setbacks, managers may resist exiting to avoid harming employees who will lose their jobs. We propose that managers with higher prosocial preferences set lower exit thresholds and select conservative investments that reduce the risk of having to exit because they experience stronger feelings of anticipatory guilt. Our field study shows that, in responding to intensifying Chinese import competition, prosocial managers are less likely to exit or divest. Our experiments (N = 1,411), including a sample of senior executives, show that anticipatory guilt mediates the negative effect of prosocial preferences on exit thresholds and risky investments. Anticipatory guilt and its effect are stronger when employees suffer greater harm from the firm’s exit due to the absence of social insurance programs, such as public health insurance or unemployment insurance. Our study presents an emotion-processual account of firm exit decisions and highlights anticipatory guilt as an emotional barrier to efficient decision-making.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Although clinical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can augment medical diagnosis decisions by providing competent second opinions, how to effectively integrate AI into routine diagnostic processes, such as when to present AI advice to human physicians, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our research experimentally examines how the timing of AI advice affects diagnostic decision making using a think-aloud approach. Physicians perform medical diagnoses under three conditions: ex post advice (AI advice given after an initial diagnosis), ex ante advice (AI advice given concurrently with clinical information), and a control condition (no AI advice). Our results indicate that the timing of AI advice significantly affects diagnostic accuracy and calibration, with the ex post advice condition yielding the best performance and the control condition the worst. We then conduct several analyses to disentangle the underlying mechanism. We reveal that the superior diagnostic quality in the ex post advice condition can be attributed to more thorough clinical information processing and more active cognitive engagement with AI’s reasoning rationale. As a result, participants in the ex post advice condition are more capable of differentiating correct from incorrect AI advice than those in the ex ante advice condition. Additionally, they benefit more from high-quality AI advice that contradicts their initial diagnoses. To gain additional insights, we estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects based on physician and clinical case characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of presenting AI advice at appropriate times during routine diagnostic processes to achieve successful decision augmentation with AI advice.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Prior research in social psychology has shown that when people feel anxious, they seek advice from others. Yet, companies that operate in high-anxiety settings (like financial services, healthcare, and education) are increasingly deploying self-service technologies (SSTs), through which anxious customers transact without access to human contact. These companies may therefore face a classic efficiency–service trade-off where gains in operational efficiency through automation also hamper service outcomes by neglecting customer anxiety. This paper, set in the high-anxiety domain of financial services, investigates the value of facilitating access to human contact during SST usage. In a field experiment conducted within the context of a credit union’s SST loan-approval process, an invitation to connect with a human loan agent increases the customer uptake rate of approved loans by 24%. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments, which explicitly investigate the linkages among anxiety, choice satisfaction, and firm trust during SST encounters show that compared with participants without anxiety, those who are anxious consistently report lower satisfaction with their choices and less trust in the firm, regardless of the source of their anxiety. When anxiety is related to the SST encounter, facilitating access to human contact dampens anxiety’s negative effects on choice satisfaction and, by extension, increases firm trust. We further observe that these benefits of facilitating access to human contact arise even though very few customers choose to access a person. Taken together, this research reveals an opportunity for firms to maintain operational efficiency in high-anxiety self-service settings without compromising customer experiences and service outcomes.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Users are now typically able to access historical data in traffic, restaurant, and retailing contexts. This availability of information can be viewed as a means to reduce congestion. However, scientific support for this notion is weak. We investigate, using a laboratory experiment, whether an intermediate level of information provision might reduce congestion. We also study how the effect of making more information available changes over time. We show that providing all users with information is counterproductive in the short run. In the long run, users’ behavior adjusts so that providing some or all individuals with information leads to more efficient outcomes than when no information is made available. Small Sample models capture a number of the patterns in the data, in particular the switching behavior between routes. The data show that making congestion information available to all parties reduces efficiency early on but is beneficial in the long run.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Business managers and policymakers must often communicate magnitudes. Yet conveying large relative magnitudes without desensitizing people to further increases can be challenging because of diminishing sensitivity to large numbers. In this research, we propose that percentage expressions not only make large relative magnitudes (e.g., 500%) appear larger than equivalent non-percentage expressions but also make large increases in relative magnitudes (e.g., from 500% to 600%) appear larger. We posit an explanation: percentages typically have values between 0% and 100%, so when percentages and percentage-point differences reach 100% or more, they seem unusually large. This hypothesis is supported by data scraped from New York Times articles and a series of online experiments employing both management-relevant scenarios and incentive-compatible decisions. Existing theories of magnitude perception either cannot predict all the results of these studies (e.g., numerosity and unitosity) or need further specification to do so (e.g., decision-by-sampling and range-frequency theory). We discuss implications for the theory of magnitude and difference perception and the practice of communicating large magnitudes and changes.

Although initial studies suggested clear advantages across cultures and contexts, recent findings have challenged the robustness of this first-mover advantage. A preregistered meta-analysis of 374 effects from 90 studies (Study 1; N = 16,334) revealed three beneficial effects of making the first offer: (a) a general first-mover advantage (g = 0.42, m = 80), (b) a positive correlation between first-offer magnitude and agreement value (r = 0.62, g = 1.56, m = 53), and (c) an advantage of ambitious (vs. moderate) first offers on agreement value (g = 1.14, m = 187). The meta-analysis also identified two detrimental outcomes of ambitious first offers: (d) fewer deals (i.e., more impasses; g = −0.42, m = 13) and (e) worse subjective value experienced by recipients (g = −0.40, m = 41). Two preregistered experiments (Study 2a-2b; N = 2,121) replicated both the beneficial and detrimental meta-analytic effects and simultaneously tested multiple psychological mechanisms driving these effects. Across the experiments, selective accessibility drove the effect of first-offer magnitude on counteroffers, while anger drove the effects on impasses and subjective value. Across both the meta-analysis and the experiments, negotiation complexity moderated both the beneficial and detrimental effects of first offers; as the number and type of issues (i.e., complexity) increased, the effects of first offers became smaller, and the mechanisms changed. Overall, the current meta-analysis and experiments collectively illuminate the direction, size, psychological pathways, and boundaries of first-offer effects in negotiations.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract From building a new piece of furniture to replacing a lightbulb, people must often figure out how to assemble an object from its parts. Although these physical assembly problems take on many different forms, they also pose common challenges. Chief among these is the question of how to break a complex problem down into subproblems that are easier to solve. What principles determine why some strategies for decomposing a problem are favored over others? Here, we investigate the decisions that people make when considering different visual subgoals in the context of attempting to build a series of virtual block towers. We hypothesized that people favor subgoals achieving a balance between how much progress the subgoals would help achieve toward the final goal and how effortful they would be to solve. We tested this hypothesis by defining several computational models of planning and subgoal selection, then evaluating how well these models predicted human planning and subgoal selection behavior on the same problems. Our results suggest that participants rapidly differentiated the computational costs of otherwise similarly ambitious subgoals, and used these judgments to drive subgoal selection. Moreover, our findings are consistent with the possibility that participants were not only sensitive to the immediate computational costs associated with solving the very next subgoal, but also future costs that might be incurred when attempting the rest of the problem. Taken together, these results contribute to our understanding of how humans make efficient use of cognitive resources to solve complex, grounded planning problems.</span>

Cognitive scientists have developed Bayesian Network models of how people integrate perceptions of source credibility when learning from information provided by sources, but these models do not involve the crucial source characteristic in politics: bias. Biased sources make claims that align with a particular political agenda, whether or not they are true. We present a novel Bayesian Network model which integrates perceptions of a source&#39;s bias as well as their expertise. We demonstrate the model&#39;s validity for predicting how people will update beliefs and perceptions of bias and expertise in response to testimony across two studies, the second being a preregistered conceptual replication and extension of the first.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been extremely successful at capturing how biological agents learn to make rewarding choices. However, there is also increasing evidence that multiple cognitive processes, including working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM), support such learning in parallel with value-based mechanisms such as RL. Here, we investigate EM&#39;s role in a context where both RL and WM are known to strongly support learning. We develop two new experimental paradigms to isolate EM&#39;s contributions, using trial-unique signals (Experiment 1) and temporal context effects (Experiment 2) to tag EM. As predicted, our results across both experiments consistently showed a weak role of EM in learning alongside RL and WM. However, surprisingly, we showed that EM&#39;s contributions did not improve overall behavior; instead, participants appeared to primarily encode in or retrieve from the EM part of a past trial&#39;s information (the stimulus-action choice, without outcome), leading to characteristic error patterns. Across both experiments, computational modeling confirmed a small contribution of traces of past stimulus-action (association) events stored in EM to learning behavior. Our results shed light on the format of EM traces and how they support decision making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Using data from over 100 US retirement plans and a representative UK panel, I document the impact of auto-enrollment (AE) on retirement savings at different horizons. I replicate the impact of AE on participation and contributions in the short run (at 12 months), but I show that these gains are attenuated over the medium run (at 36 months). At this longer horizon, the average savings increases are modest, though AE significantly lowers inequality in savings. To assess AE’s lifetime impact, I estimate a life cycle consumption-savings model that can fit the observed patterns with a switching cost of approximately $250, smaller than previous estimates.
