                  <span style="color:#374151;">Computational modelling is a powerful tool for uncovering hidden processes in observed data, yet it faces underappreciated challenges. Among these, determining appropriate sample sizes for computational studies remains a critical but overlooked issue, particularly for model selection analyses. Here we introduce a power analysis framework for Bayesian model selection, a method widely used to choose the best model among alternatives. Our framework reveals that while power increases with sample size, it decreases as more models are considered. Using this framework, we empirically demonstrate that psychology and human neuroscience studies often suffer from low statistical power in model selection. A total of 41 of 52 studies reviewed had less than 80% probability of correctly identifying the true model. The field also heavily relies on fixed effects model selection, which we demonstrate has serious statistical issues, including high false positive rates and pronounced sensitivity to outliers.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have had tremendous success accounting for reward-based learning across species, including instrumental learning in contextual bandit tasks, and they capture variance in brain signals. However, reward-based learning in humans recruits multiple processes, including memory and choice perseveration; their contributions can easily be mistakenly attributed to RL computations. Here I investigate how much of reward-based learning behaviour is supported by RL computations in a context where other processes can be factored out. Reanalysis and computational modelling of 7 datasets ( n = 594) in diverse samples show that in this instrumental context, reward-based learning is best explained by a combination of a fast working-memory-based process and a slower habit-like associative process, neither of which can be interpreted as a standard RL-like algorithm on its own. My results raise important questions for the interpretation of RL algorithms as capturing a meaningful process across brain and behaviour.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We examine the additivity of expectations over different time intervals. For example, when asked about 10-year stock price growth, survey respondents report an expected change that is not equal to, but closer to zero than, the sum of their expectations over two shorter time intervals that cover the same 10 years. Such subadditivity, which we also find in expectations for other economic variables, is irrational, as it cannot stem from aggregating short-term expectations. Model estimates show that the pattern is consistent with a time perception where shorter time intervals have a proportionally larger weight. We also find that the respondents’ degree of additivity is correlated with making larger financial investments. This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We recover forward-looking expected net-of-fee abnormal returns (alphas) for active equity mutual funds from analyst ratings. In contrast to the typical equilibrium implication of zero alphas, analyst alphas are negative for most funds, but positive for the largest funds. We compare analysts’ subjective expectations with expectations from a rational expectations learning model. The model’s rational learner believes that an increase in fund size leads to a decrease in returns, but we find no evidence that analysts believe so. Consistently, counterfactual ratings based on the rational model tend to outperform analysts’ ratings out of sample. Investor fund flows respond significantly to analyst ratings.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study household finance in the age of FinTech, where digital payments are integrated with various financial services through all-in-one super apps. We hypothesize that increased FinTech adoption via digital payments can lower the nonmonetary costs (e.g., psychological barriers) associated with financial market participation. We find that higher FinTech adoption leads to greater participation and increased risk taking in mutual fund investments. Using distance from Ant as an instrument for FinTech penetration, as well as the exogenous penetration of QRPay in Shenzhen, we further provide causal evidence from digital payment to risky fund investment. Moreover, the effect of FinTech is stronger among individuals who are otherwise more constrained, those with higher risk tolerance, or those living in under-banked counties.
