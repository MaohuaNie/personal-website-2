                  <span style="color:#374151;">Can models incorporating nontraditional, behavioral elements into the classical, expected-utility framework help explain seemingly dominated choice behavior of participants in centralized matching markets? Can they help in redesigning matching mechanisms to reduce such behavior? Investigating the widely used deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm, we answer positively, both in theory and using laboratory experiments. We use an off-the-shelf news-utility model where preferences include expectations-based reference dependence (EBRD): individuals care not only about actual consumption but also about news (relative to previously held expectations) regarding consumption. Each participant in our laboratory experiments (N = 500) plays 10 simulated large-market school-assignment problems of varying competitiveness, in one of four ([Formula: see text]) different DA variants. They vary by whether individuals submit their rankings prior to the matching process (a static implementation) or make sequential decisions (a dynamic implementation), and whether they are on the proposing or receiving side: [Formula: see text]static, dynamic[Formula: see text]student proposing, student receiving[Formula: see text]. Whereas a traditional, reference-independent model predicts the same straightforward behavior across all problems and variants, a news-utility EBRD model predicts stark differences across them. Intuitively, to avert losses from bad news, EBRD individuals may downrank, or even avoid applying to, competitive positions that, when offered to them (with certainty), they will accept. Consistent with our predictions, we find that (i) across DA variants, dynamic student receiving leads to significantly fewer deviations from straightforward behavior; (ii) across problems within the other three variants, deviations increase with problem competitiveness; and (iii) in those three variants, the specific deviations predicted by EBRD are indeed those commonly observed empirically. We discuss practical implications. This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How frequent are large disagreements in human judgment? The substantial literature relating to expert assessments of real-valued quantities and their aggregation almost universally assumes that judgment errors follow a jointly normal distribution. We investigate this question empirically using 73 data sets from four different sources that include over 169,000 estimates and forecasts. We find incontrovertible evidence for excess kurtosis: that is, of fat tails. Despite the diversity of the analyzed data, varying in how much uncertainty there is in the quantity being assessed and varying in the level of expertise and of sophistication of those making the assessments, we find surprising consistency in the frequency with which an individual judgment is in large disagreement with the consensus. Fitting a generalized normal distribution to the data, we find most estimates for the shape parameter to be between 0.9 and 1.6 (where 1 is the double-exponential distribution and 2 is the normal distribution). This has important implications, in particular for the aggregation of expert estimates and forecasts and for the construction of confidence intervals. We describe optimal Bayesian aggregation with fat tails and propose a simple average-median average heuristic that performs well for the range of empirically observed distributions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">The impact of memory on economic choices can be essential, but empirical evidence of the link between them remains scarce. This study examines whether the retrieval of memories related to economic recessions affects the changes in the bias in management forecasts. Using the 2008 financial crisis as a memory trigger and focusing on annual management earnings forecasts issued for fiscal years ending between 2002 and 2018, we find that chief executive officers (CEOs) with more long-term memories of leading through past recessions and those with more intense recent memories of the financial crisis embed greater pessimism in their forecasts after the financial crisis. These findings support the retrieved-context theory in human memory as well as the availability heuristic and the recency effect in psychology. Further analyses show that it takes about three years for the increased pessimism in management forecasts to return to the pre-crisis level, mainly for CEOs with more memories of past recessions. These findings suggest that memory retrieval may delay managers’ learning after the financial crisis. Our study offers new insights into the role that memory plays in managers’ decision making.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Human adaptation depends on individuals strategically choosing whom to learn from. A mosaic of social learning strategies—such as copying majorities or successful others—has been identified. Influential theories conceive of these strategies as fixed heuristics, independent of experience. However, such accounts cannot explain the flexibility and individual variability prevalent in social learning. Here we advance a domain-general reward learning framework that provides a unifying mechanistic account of pivotal social learning strategies. We first formalize how individuals learn to associate social features (for example, others’ behaviour or success) with reward. Across six experiments ( n = 1,941), we show that people flexibly adjust their social learning in response to experienced rewards. Agent-based simulations further demonstrate how this learning process gives rise to key social learning strategies across a range of environments. Our findings suggest that people learn how to learn from others, enabling adaptive knowledge to spread dynamically throughout societies.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">A cornerstone of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly adjust our cognition and behavior as our goals change. For instance, achieving some goals requires efficiency, while others require caution. Different goals require us to engage different control processes, such as adjusting how attentive and cautious we are. Here, we show that performance incurs control adjustment costs when people adjust control to meet changing goals. Across four experiments, we provide evidence of these costs and validate a dynamical systems model explaining the source of these costs. Participants performed a single cognitively demanding task under varying performance goals (e.g., being fast or accurate). We modeled control allocation to include a dynamic process of adjusting from one&#39;s current control state to a target state for a given performance goal. By incorporating inertia into this adjustment process, our model accounts for our empirical finding that people undershoot their target control state more (i.e., exhibit larger adjustment costs) when goals switch rather than remain fixed (Study 1). Further validating our model, we show that the magnitude of this cost is increased when: distances between target states are larger (Study 2), there is less time to adjust to the new goal (Study 3), and goal switches are more frequent (Study 4). Our findings characterize the costs of adjusting control to meet changing goals and show that these costs emerge directly from cognitive control dynamics. In so doing, they shed new light on the sources of and constraints on flexibility of goal-directed behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias in which people rely heavily on an initial piece of information when making judgments or decisions. Once an anchor – typically an objective numerical value – is set, subsequent assessments are adjusted around it, often insufficiently. The extent to which this effect influences cognitive load assessments is unclear. Particularly when students are required to assess cognitive load multiple times during problem-solving, they may resort to heuristics to simplify the cognitively demanding decision-making process. This experimental series aimed to investigate whether anchoring biases cognitive load assessments when students evaluated the cognitive load of several problem-solving tasks. Across three experiments ( N 1 = 100, N 2 = 87, N 3 = 80) students assessed the cognitive load of tasks with varying levels of element interactivity (low, moderate, high) multiple times during problem solving. Task sequences were varied to examine whether the first impression of complexity influenced subsequent assessments. The results were mixed: In Experiments 1 and 2, the first impression did not influence the following assessment, but Experiment 3 confirmed the hypothesized anchoring effect. However, this finding cannot be solely attributed to anchoring, as several factors – such as subjective perceptions of complexity, scale effects, task-specific differences, and memory and consistency effects – may have contributed. The findings suggest that anchoring is more likely to occur when there is a substantial contrast between the anchor and subsequent assessments. Furthermore, objective anchors, such as pre-defined numerical values, may exert a stronger influence on decision-making processes than subjective ones, like self-generated assessments.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">The congruency sequence effect (CSE), or Gratton effect, describes diminished congruency effects (i.e., faster responses for &lt;&lt; stimuli in a flanker task) on trials following an incongruent trial compared to those following a congruent trial. Traditionally, the CSE is regarded as an index of conflict adaptation. Accounts of the CSE have typically emphasized either top-down (cognitive control) or bottom-up (associative) processes. To disentangle top-down and bottom-up contributions to the CSE, we compared performance on versions of Simon and flanker tasks that control for memory and learning effects present in the standard versions of these tasks with the standard tasks. We analyzed the data using a recently developed model that explains conflict effects in terms of attention-shifting dynamics, the revised diffusion model for conflict tasks. Our modeling analyses suggest the CSEs in both Simon tasks are mainly driven by across-trial changes in the way attention is loaded onto distractor information, consistent with top-down control. In contrast, for both flanker tasks, our model-based analysis does not provide clear evidence favoring either top-down or bottom-up contributions to the CSEs overall. Furthermore, we fit the standard version of these tasks while separately analyzing trials based on whether the response was repeated or alternated across successive trials. Model fits suggest a combination of both influences, with different patterns for congruent and incongruent trials. Performance benefits on congruent trials are driven by adjusting how attention is loaded onto distractor information based on the previous congruency types (i.e., top-down influence). However, on incongruent trials, asymmetrical repetition benefits are mainly due to faster memory retrieval (i.e., bottom-up influence) and reactive attentional control. Our findings highlight that a more nuanced and integrated theoretical framework is necessary to capture the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes in explaining control mechanisms when analyzing different response sequences.
