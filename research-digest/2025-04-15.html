                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Economic choices are difficult and computationally complex. To make good decisions one needs to integrate different variables and resolve several trade-offs. We study whether providing external tools which help reducing the computational complexity of choices improves risky decisions. We find mixed evidence for the effectiveness of these tools, as people tend to rarely use them. Overall, cognitive offloading tools make people less risk averse and better at updating beliefs, but they do not decrease irrational behavior, in the sense of the proportion of dominated choices, violations of expected utility, and sub-optimal budget allocations. These results suggest that simply providing external tools, which make choices (computationally) easier, but where using these aids is discretional, has a limited impact on improving people’s choices under risk.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract We report the evidence of a multi-stage lab experiment on individual decision making under ambiguity, where the latter is characterized by the (partial or) absence of information on some monetary values in the support of the lottery distributions. This complements the standard treatment of uncertainty where decision makers know the monetary prizes, but probabilities are uncertain. We use both a structural and a non-structural approach when analyzing subjects’ behavior under risk, compound risk, and outcome ambiguity. Our main finding is that subjects are risk-averse and ambiguity lovers in that they evaluate more optimistically uncertain payoffs under ambiguity compared to compound risk. We also study how subjects evaluate scenarios with uncertain outcomes: 60% of choices are consistent with the Expected Utility paradigm, while 40% of them are better described by a heuristic we label as “naïve,” in which the order of integration of Expected Utility is reversed (that is, they first form a point estimate of the uncertain payoffs, and then they evaluate the lotteries’ expected utility). Finally, we also find that risk and ambiguity aversion are positively correlated.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">In many settings, a person’s outcome depends not only on her own behavior, but also on her counterpart’s. Such strategic decisions have traditionally been studied using normative game theory, which assumes that people adopt equilibrium strategies and will reach the same decision, regardless of how the problem is described (framed). We examine a potentially important type of framing effect—focusing on how the relationship between players’ actions generates joint outcomes. Any strategic interaction can be described by either spelling out the outcomes of all possible action combinations (which we call “outcome framing,” or simply “O-framing”) or describing what will happen if different players choose the same action or choose different actions (which we call “relation framing,” or simply “R-framing”). O-framing has been the typical way to describe a strategic problem in prior work, whereas R-framing is commonly employed in real-life communications. We propose that these functionally equivalent frames induce different psychological processes and lead to different decisions: Relative to O-framing, R-framing increases players’ beliefs about their counterparts’ likelihood of coordinating on a cooperative option. We demonstrate this effect in the context of classic games such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Stag Hunt. We find that, compared with O-framing, R-framing significantly increases people’s likelihood to choose the action that maximizes collective benefits rather than individual interests, and it does so by increasing beliefs that one’s partner will choose the same action as well. We derive conditions when this effect is likely to emerge and discuss the managerial implications of this research.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We propose a theory for rating financial securities in the presence of structural maximization by the issuer in a market with investors who rely on credit rating. Two types of investors, simple investors who price tranches solely based on the ratings and model-based investors who use the rating information to calibrate models, are considered. Concepts of self-consistency and information gap are proposed to study different rating criteria. In particular, the expected loss criterion used by Moody’s satisfies self-consistency, but the probability of default criterion used by Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s does not. Moreover, the probability of default criterion typically has a higher information gap than the expected loss criterion. Empirical evidence in the post–Dodd–Frank period is consistent with our theoretical implications. We show that a set of axioms based on self-consistency leads to a tractable representation for all self-consistent rating criteria, which can also be extended to incorporate economic scenarios. New examples of self-consistent and scenario-based rating criteria are suggested. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">The secretary problem is probably the most well-studied optimal stopping problem with many applications in economics and management. In the secretary problem, a decision maker faces an unknown sequence of values, revealed successively, and has to make irrevocable take-it-or-leave-it decisions. Her goal is to select the maximum value in the sequence. Although in the classic secretary problem the values of upcoming elements are entirely unknown, in many realistic situations, the decision maker has access to some information, for example, from past data. In this paper, we take a sampling approach and assume that before starting the sequence, each element is sampled independently with probability p. We study both the adversarial and the random arrival models. Our main result is to obtain the best possible algorithms for both settings and all values of p. As p grows to one, the obtained guarantees converge to the optimal guarantees in the full information case. Notably, we establish that the best possible algorithm in the adversarial order setting is a fixed threshold algorithm. In the random order setting, we characterize the best possible algorithm by a sequence of thresholds, dictating at which point in time we should accept a value. Surprisingly, this sequence is independent of p. We complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments on data of people playing the secretary problem repeatedly. Our results help explain some behavioral issues they raised and indicate that people play a strategy similar to our optimal algorithms from the start onwards, albeit slightly suboptimally.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We explore how information ambiguity and traders’ attitudes toward such ambiguity affect expectations and asset prices under three different market institutions. Specifically, we test a theoretical prediction that information ambiguity will lead market prices to overreact to bad news and underreact to good news. We find that such an asymmetric reaction exists and is strongest in individual prediction markets. It occurs to a lesser extent in single price call markets. It is weakest of all in double auction markets, in which buyers’ asymmetric reaction to good/bad news is cancelled out by the opposite asymmetric reaction of sellers.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Despite evidence of the importance of sleep for cognitive performance, prior research finds limited effects of sleep disruptions on financial markets. This is puzzling because financial decisions rely on higher-order cognitive processes that are typically affected by sleep. We reconcile this dissonance by examining forecasts of corporate earnings by nonprofessional and professional forecasters. We find that nonprofessional forecasters exhibit a significant decline in their forecast accuracy following spring daylight saving time changes relative to professional forecasters. Using a separate sample of professional equity analysts’ forecasts, we continue to find that the information processing of analysts with less expertise is disproportionately negatively affected following sleep disruptions. Placebo tests provide support for sleep disruptions as the main driver of these effects. Overall, our evidence that information processing by less experienced and skilled market participants is particularly vulnerable to sleep disruptions provides one compelling reason why aggregate financial markets seem to be immune to sleep effects even though individual participants are not.

We investigate the causal effects of such real-time feedback on individual effort and the quality of initial (prefeedback) and final (postfeedback) decisions by exploiting a natural quasi-experiment in the setting of professional soccer refereeing. Our results suggest that real-time feedback has differential effects for experienced compared with inexperienced agents. Specifically, we find some evidence that experienced agents decrease their effort under real-time feedback without harming the quality of their initial decisions. This results in better final decisions because real-time feedback allows agents to correct wrong initial decisions upon feedback. In contrast, inexperienced agents increase their effort, but make worse initial decisions. Upon feedback, they manage to compensate for their increased number of wrong initial decisions, but see no improvement in the quality of final decisions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Efficiently managing inventories requires an accurate estimation of stockout costs. This estimation is complicated by challenges in determining how to compensate consumers monetarily to ensure they will maintain the same level of utility they would have obtained had stockouts not occurred. This paper presents an analysis of these compensation costs as applied to the design of optimal stockout rates by an online retailer marketing to consumers aesthetically substandard fruits and vegetables rejected by mainstream grocery chains. Because growers face high uncertainty in their harvesting conditions and in the aesthetic quality of their crops and there are little data on hand to predict the value consumers attach to the availability of subpar produce, it is difficult to optimally match the supply of these products with consumers’ demand. Our analysis draws from a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) choice model to calculate consumer compensations that the retailer can use to estimate the opportunity costs of stockouts to manage its inventory. We show that not taking into account these compensation costs could unduly inflate the optimal stockout rates for these products. Armed with these compensation cost estimates, we show how these costs can serve as incentives for retailers to source greater inventory amounts of imperfect produce from growers and how this will ultimately translate into less waste in the supply chain.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Learning accurate beliefs about the world is computationally demanding but critical for adaptive behavior across the lifespan. Here, we build on an established framework formalizing learning as predictive inference and examine the possibility that age differences in learning emerge from efficient computations that consider available cognitive resources differing across the lifespan. In our resource-rational model, beliefs are updated through a sampling process that stops after reaching a criterion level of accuracy. The sampling process navigates a trade-off between belief accuracy and computational cost, with more samples favoring belief accuracy and fewer samples minimizing costs. When cognitive resources are limited or costly, a maximization of the accuracy-cost ratio requires a more frugal sampling policy, which leads to systematically biased beliefs. Data from two lifespan studies (N = 129 and N = 90) and one study in younger adults (N = 94) show that children and older adults display biases characteristic of a more frugal sampling policy. This is reflected in (a) more frequent perseveration when participants are required to update from previous beliefs and (b) a stronger anchoring bias when updating beliefs from an externally generated value. These results are qualitatively consistent with simulated predictions of our resource-rational model, corroborating the assumption that the identified biases originate from sampling. Our model and results provide a unifying perspective on perseverative and anchoring biases, show that they can jointly emerge from efficient belief-updating computations, and suggest that resource-rational adjustments of sampling computations can explain age-related changes in adaptive learning.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">A recent line of research has shown that humans and rodents can monitor errors in their timing behavior in individual trials. This ability is called temporal error monitoring (TEM). Electrophysiological studies showed that TEM-related neural signals of error are present before the timing behavior is manifested. These results have crucial implications for the function and modeling of TEM as they show that timing errors are read out rather than detected retrospectively. Such real-time error monitoring allows emergent timing error signals to improve the impending timing behavior in a prospective fashion (e.g., increasing the timing threshold when &quot;earlier-than-target&quot; errors are detected), enabling within-trial error corrections. In this article, we present a drift-diffusion model of real-time TEM with prospective (within-trial) behavioral modulation/refinement elements that are sensitive to task representations. Our model predicts the read-out of timing signals before the manifestation of the timing behavior and the translation of these signals into the improvement of timing accuracy within individual trials (thus improving overall precision) without violating the psychophysical and statistical features of the timing behavior. Finally, the task representation dependency of the decision element accounts for the widely reported reward-rate maximizing timing behavior. Our model introduces a new theoretical foundation for TEM with many testable behavioral and electrophysiological predictions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">It is widely accepted that upright faces are processed more holistically than inverted faces, but there is limited evidence on how face orientation affects holistic processing in conflict tasks and how this differs in arrow and gaze processing. To address these gaps, we devised a novel arrow-gaze Stroop task involving both arrow and gaze judgments. Our results show that face orientation does not influence the congruency effect in this Stroop task. However, the congruency effect is significantly stronger for gaze judgments than for arrow judgments. We used hierarchical Bayesian estimation to evaluate three conflict drift-diffusion models-the diffusion model for conflict tasks, the dual-stage two-phase model, and the shrinking spotlight model (SSP)-to examine holistic cognitive control mechanisms. Our model-based analysis reveals that the SSP outperforms the diffusion model for conflict and dual-stage two-phase models. Representational similarity analysis of the SSP model parameters between gaze and arrow judgments suggests two key findings: (a) Feature-based processing of both arrow and gaze tasks, along with conflict-related factors, explains the similar congruency effects observed across both face orientations, while the processing speed of relevant stimulus attributes impacts overall performance, and (b) there are both shared and dissociable attentional effects between gaze and arrow processing. These findings provide new insights into the shared computational mechanisms underlying social and nonsocial cognitive control processes.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Theories of individual differences are foundational to psychological and brain sciences, yet they are traditionally developed and tested using superficial summaries of data (e.g., mean response times) that are disconnected from our otherwise rich conceptual theories of behavior. To resolve this theory-description gap, we review the generative modeling approach, which involves formally specifying how behavior is generated within individuals, and in turn how generative mechanisms vary across individuals. Generative modeling shifts our focus away from estimating descriptive statistical &quot;effects&quot; toward estimating psychologically interpretable parameters, while simultaneously enhancing the reliability and validity of our measures. We demonstrate the utility of generative modeling in the context of the &quot;reliability paradox,&quot; a phenomenon wherein replicable group effects (e.g., Stroop effect) fail to capture individual differences (e.g., low test-retest reliability). Simulations and empirical data from the Implicit Association Test and Stroop, Flanker, Posner, and delay discounting tasks show that generative models yield (a) more theoretically informative parameters, and (b) higher test-retest reliability estimates relative to traditional approaches, illustrating their potential for enhancing theory development.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Policies, the mappings from states to actions, require memory. The amount of memory is dictated by the mutual information between states and actions or the policy complexity. High-complexity policies preserve state information and generally lead to greater rewards compared to low-complexity policies, which require less memory by discarding state information and exploiting environmental regularities. Under this theory, high-complexity policies incur a time cost: They take longer to decode than low-complexity policies. This naturally gives rise to a speed-accuracy trade-off, in which acting quickly necessitates inaccuracy (via low-complexity policies) and acting accurately necessitates acting slowly (via high-complexity policies). Furthermore, the relationship between policy complexity and decoding speed accounts for set-size effects: Response times grow as a function of the number of possible states because larger state sets encourage higher policy complexity. Across three experiments, we tested these predictions by manipulating intertrial intervals, environmental regularities, and state set sizes. In all cases, we found that humans are sensitive to both time and memory costs when modulating policy complexity. Altogether, our theory suggests that policy complexity constraints may underlie some speed-accuracy trade-offs and set-size effects.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In evaluating changing attributes (e.g., work output, pollution levels), perceivers care not only about an attribute&#39;s level but its rate of change. Two employees likely have different value in the eyes of a supervisor if they take different amounts of time to complete the same work. Ten studies in the main article (and five in the Supplemental Materials) document and explore a monitoring frequency effect (MFE): Progress is seen to slow to the extent it is monitored more frequently. This effect was observed across various domains (workplace, public health, environmental, investment, physical growth) and was robust to financial incentives that encouraged accuracy. Several factors are identified that affect preferences for monitoring targets more or less frequently. Participants also displayed preferences for how frequently they themselves would be monitored; this investigation directly revealed the counterintuitive nature of the MFE. Although the MFE was robust to all tested variants, the size of the MFE did depend on how information about attribute changes was presented. Two mechanistic accounts-one rooted in memory biases for tracked information and the other in a failure to synthesize the tracked information in a normative way-were tested. Only the latter was supported. Discussion focuses on how the MFE complements or only superficially contradicts previous work on myopic loss aversion, the ratio bias, partition dependence, and tracking goal progress. The MFE identifies a qualitatively distinct way by which prior evaluations and beliefs can color evaluations of targets, thereby reinforcing even misguided priors.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT People take more risks when deciding on their foreign language. In three lab experiments ( N = 424), we explored two explanations of this phenomenon: reduced anticipation of regret or increased accessibility of risk‐increasing thoughts. Participants in native or foreign language conditions considered two prenatal tests: a less sensitive but safe and a more sensitive one—their task was to specify the level of risk of miscarriage of the more sensitive test while still choosing it. Subsequently, they estimated the anticipated regret associated with not selecting the riskier test and discovering the child has a detectable disorder (Experiments 1 and 2) or with taking the riskier test and miscarrying (Experiment 3). Three studies confirmed a greater willingness to accept risk when using a foreign language (meta‐analytic effect d = 0.40), but this effect was not mediated by changes in the accessibility of thoughts or anticipated regret.</span>
