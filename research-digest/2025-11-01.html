                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Currently, formal models of addiction focus either on the complex individual decision-making processes involved in addiction or on the social dynamics of addiction. They do not integrate these two levels, which has been identified as a key shortcoming of current formal models of addiction. To address this, we propose a nonlinear dynamical modeling framework of addiction integrating both the individual level and social level of addictive behavior. The individual level of our modeling framework is a formalization of a dual-process theory, where one type of process increases the consumption of addictive goods, and another type of process limits consumption. For our formalization, we build on a well-studied model from ecology, originally used to model periodic outbreaks of the spruce budworm population. To this model, we add the process of incentive sensitization at the individual level and at the social level, we incorporate the critical processes of selection homophily and peer influence. We show that our integrated modeling framework can be used to explain key phenomena identified in addiction literature: a gradual transition to heavy use, sudden relapse and sudden quitting, relatively stable use states over time (i.e., abstinence moderate use, and heavy use), social contagion and sudden outbreaks, clustering of users, and social aid in recovery. In addition, we demonstrate how our modeling framework can be extended to include mutualistic, competitive, and more complex interactions between different addictive behaviors. Finally, we show how our framework can lead to new insights and predictions and suggest avenues for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Consideration sets play a crucial role in discrete choice modeling, where customers often form consideration sets in the first stage and then use a second-stage choice mechanism to select the product with the highest utility. Although many recent studies aim to improve choice models by incorporating more sophisticated second-stage choice mechanisms, this paper takes a step back and goes into the opposite extreme. We simplify the second-stage choice mechanism to its most basic form and focus on modeling customer choice by emphasizing the role and power of the first-stage consideration set formation. To this end, we study a model that is parameterized solely by a distribution over consideration sets with a bounded rationality interpretation. Intriguingly, we show that this model is characterized by the axiom of symmetric demand cannibalization, enabling complete statistical identification. The latter finding highlights the critical role of consideration sets in the identifiability of two-stage choice models. We also examine the model’s implications for assortment planning, proving that the optimal assortment is revenue-ordered within each partition block created by consideration sets. Despite this compelling structure, we establish that the assortment problem under this model is NP-hard even to approximate, highlighting how consideration sets contribute to nontractability, even under the simplest uniform second-stage choice mechanism. Finally, using real-world data, we show that the model achieves prediction performance comparable to other advanced choice models. Given the simplicity of the model’s second-stage phase, this result showcases the enormous power of first-stage consideration set formation in capturing customers’ decision-making processes.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Although maximizing quantiles is intuitively appealing and has an axiomatic foundation, it is difficult to find the optimal portfolio strategy because of time inconsistency. Using an intrapersonal equilibrium approach and focusing on the class of time-varying affine strategies, we find that the only viable outcome is from the median maximization because for other quantiles, either the equilibrium does not exist or there is no investment in risky assets. We also prove that maximizing the median endogenizes the use of portfolio insurance. The calibration of the model uncovers a new empirical phenomenon: “portfolio share smile.” This paper was accepted by Giesecke Kay, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How can we compare approaches to increase retirement savings? Messaging interventions, active choice frameworks, and automatic enrollment all increase retirement savings, but evidence supporting these approaches spans widely different institutional settings, populations, and time periods. In this study, we use experimental and quasi-experimental variation in these approaches within a constant setting using interventions in the U.S. military during 2016–2018. We find large differences in the efficacy of these approaches, with active choice and automatic enrollment programs being about 10 and 100 times more effective than messaging interventions, respectively. We also collect novel data on program costs and generate estimates of cost-effectiveness for each program. We find that active choice and automatic enrollment are consistently more cost effective than any messaging interventions, active choice programs are the most cost-effective for small firms, and automatic enrollment is the most cost-effective program for larger firms.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Across myriad real-world contexts, people encounter the challenge of learning to take actions that bring about desirable outcomes. The theoretical framework of reinforcement learning proposes formal algorithms through which agents learn from experience to make rewarding choices. These formal models capture many aspects of reward-guided human behavior in controlled laboratory contexts. Here, we suggest that the algorithms and the constructs (i.e., states, actions, and rewards) formalized within reinforcement-learning theory can be operationally defined and extended to additionally account for learning in complex natural environments. We discuss several recent examples of empirical studies that provide evidence of signatures of reinforcement learning across diverse human behaviors in everyday environments.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Category learning involves grouping items based on their shared characteristics or a shared association. Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hr apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype, exemplar, and unidimensional rule model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal categorization models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young adult levels.
