                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Although listeners may have the competence to engage in a word-by-word analysis to build a syntactic representation of a heard sentence, in everyday conversation, listeners may, almost by necessity, process the sentence only to a shallow or “good enough” level to derive its meaning. The possibility has been raised that processing schemata may be flexible, such that under some circumstances, comprehension decisions are more likely to be based on an incomplete analysis. We report two experiments in which adult participants were tested on their ability to determine the meaning of auditorily presented plausible or implausible sentences. In both experiments, participants were given two different orienting instructions while completing the listening task (instructions that emphasized either the speed or accuracy of the comprehension decision). In Experiment 1, we also manipulated spectral clarity such that speech was either heard clearly or degraded in spectral richness. A unique use of hierarchical drift–diffusion modeling was employed to probe latent decision-making processes that influenced the participants’ comprehension decision. Results indicate that orienting instructions that emphasize speed and perceptual challenge both increase the likelihood that the assumed meaning of implausible sentences will be based on plausibility. Drift–diffusion modeling revealed a dissociation where orienting instructions selectively influenced the amount of evidence required for the participant to make a comprehension decision while sentence plausibility selectively influenced the rate of evidence accumulation. These drift–diffusion model findings were replicated in Experiment 2. Results suggest that comprehension processes are highly flexible and can be characterized in terms of underlying decision-making mechanisms.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study the relationship between the distribution of investor beliefs, the breadth of ownership, and expected returns in a model where stocks differ in the intensity of disagreement and in the extent to which beliefs are polarized, as measured by the number of optimists and pessimists relative to moderates. Polarization explains the size-dependent relationship between breadth and expected returns that we find empirically: positive for large stocks and negative for small stocks. We also find empirical support for the underlying mechanism: polarized stocks earn lower expected returns and are held more broadly if small and less broadly if large.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Ensuring product availability and successful order fulfillment are critical priorities for any retail company. In this paper, we explore how sharing information about low-availability items (LAIs) can influence customer purchase decisions both in preventing stockouts and mitigating their negative effects. The net impact of sharing information on LAIs is difficult to predict ex ante because multiple effects may act in opposite directions. On the one hand, sharing information could discourage LAI purchases from customers who are averse to stockouts. On the other hand, such information might increase the demand for LAIs because of cognitive biases that make scarce items seem more appealing. In a field experiment with more than 840,000 Instacart customers, we first find that customers are 25% less likely to purchase LAIs when item availability information is disclosed. This effect is not uniform; it is more pronounced when customers shop at new stores, when they have previously encountered lower found rates on the platform, and when they have less experience using the platform. Importantly, LAI disclosure has a positive impact on the platform’s performance in both the short and long term. Specifically, this innovative and extremely low-cost policy results in a 5.8% increase in customer spending and a 5.7% increase in order frequency over the long term. Our analysis suggests that this positive effect is driven by several factors: the improved service quality experienced by customers, as evidenced by a 3.7% reduction in refunds, a 2.9% decrease in product replacements, and a 7.5% reduction in poor product replacement ratings when replacements do occur; increased customer exploration of different stores; and higher spending per order because of fewer refunds and the exploration of potentially more expensive product substitutes. In the context of online retail, a policy of disclosing LAIs can improve customer decision-making by providing stock information, reduce stockouts, enhance satisfaction by managing expectations and transparency, and promote exploration of more platform options.
