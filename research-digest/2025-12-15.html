                  <span style="color:#374151;">When returns are partially predictable and trading is costly, utility-maximizing investors track a target portfolio at a constant trading speed. The target portfolio is optimal for a frictionless market, where asset returns are scaled back to account for trading costs and volatilities are adjusted to proxy the “execution risk” of holding assets that are costly to trade and exposed to volatile states. The trading speed solves an optimal execution problem, which describes how the legacy portfolio inherited from the past is traded toward the target portfolio in an optimal manner. Unlike for period-by-period mean-variance preferences, the target portfolio hedges changes in investment opportunities, and both it and the trading speed are linked and depend on execution risk. We set the problem out first in an “absolute” framework—price shocks independent of the price level, and investors have CARA preferences—and then in a “relative” framework, with price shocks scaled by price levels and CRRA preferences. We illustrate the practical implications of these results in a model where market return predictions are based on a short-term momentum and a long-term value signal.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Optimizing the treatment regimen is a fundamental medical decision-making problem. This can be thought of as a two-dimensional decision-making problem with a nested structure because it involves determining both the optimal medication and its optimal dose. Identifying the most effective medication for an individual often poses considerable difficulty, and even when a suitable medication is ascertained, dosing it optimally remains a significant challenge. Making these two nested decisions necessitates the adaptive learning of a personalized disease progression control model. To address this problem, we propose a novel contextual multiarmed bandit model under a two-dimensional control with a nested structure. For this model, we develop a new joint contextual learning and optimization algorithm, termed the stochastic subgradient descent atop contextual multiarmed bandit (SGD-MAB) algorithm. It sequentially selects for a patient (i) the best medication based on their contextual information and (ii) the corresponding dose optimized over the prior history of those patients who received the same medication. We prove that it admits a sublinear regret, which is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Our regret analysis leverages the strengths of both contextual bandit approaches and online convex optimization techniques in a seamless fashion. We substantiate the practicality of SGD-MAB using clinical data on patients with hypertension and heightened cardiovascular risks. Our analysis indicates that SGD-MAB has the potential to surpass current practices. We benchmark several policies to show the advantages of our approach and offer critical insights. Our framework holds promise for various applications beyond healthcare that require nested decision-making. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Traders operating in informal economies tend to use nonaccounting metrics in their credit allocation decisions. By using a combination of survey questions and a hypothetical choice experiment, we explore wholesalers’ preferences for retailers’ accounting information and, importantly, the reasons for its limited use. Based on estimates of wholesalers’ willingness to pay for retailer information, we find that, although wholesalers continue to value nonaccounting information such as retailers’ community membership and relationship length, wholesalers also overwhelmingly value sales and profits in making credit decisions. However, wholesalers do not use accounting information because it is perceived to be unreliable, and retailers do not share this information because it might be misused. Our findings suggest that improving the reliability of accounting information and preventing its misuse will increase the use of such information in credit allocation in informal markets.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Can algorithms help people detect deception in high-stakes strategic interactions? Participants watching the preplay communication of contestants in the TV show Golden Balls display a limited ability to predict contestants’ behavior, whereas algorithms do significantly better. To increase participants’ accuracy, we provide them with algorithmic advice by flagging videos for which an algorithm predicts a high likelihood of cooperation or defection. We test how the effectiveness of flags depends on their timing. We show that participants rely significantly more on flags shown before they watch the videos than flags shown after they watch them. These findings show that the timing of algorithmic feedback is key for its adoption. This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We provide novel evidence that aggregate investor attention to stocks predicts marketwide returns, but with a striking difference across investor clienteles. Daily aggregate retail attention (ARA) negatively predicts one-week-ahead market returns, is associated with aggregate retail order imbalance and flows to equity mutual funds, and exhibits a stronger predictability during periods of high marketwide uncertainty, poor liquidity, or more costly short selling. In contrast, aggregate institutional attention (AIA), when observed before major news announcements, positively predict future marketwide returns. In cross-sectional analysis, we show that the predictability is stronger for ARA among illiquid stocks and for AIA among high-beta stocks. The predictability results are robust out-of-sample and correspond to meaningful expected utility gains even for diversified investors. The findings are consistent with the idea that attention-driven retail buying can generate an aggregate price pressure on the stock market, whereas institutional attention precedes the resolution of marketwide uncertainty and the accrual of risk premiums.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We uncover a significant friction in small business lending: perception of risk by Small Business Administration (SBA) employees. Using novel data on SBA employees transferring across offices, we find that more current defaults on SBA loans in their previous location reduce SBA loans and job creation in their current location. The effect is independent of local economic conditions and the informational content of the nonlocal defaults, suggesting that SBA employees update their risk assessment irrationally. Our results are the first to document that regulators’ misperception of economic conditions affects the ability of small businesses to obtain access to finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Using various measures of economic uncertainty, we find that the beta-alpha anomaly exists only during periods of low economic uncertainty. We argue that diminished risk appetite during high economic uncertainty eases leverage constraints of typical long-only investors, making overvaluation of high-beta stocks and undervaluation of low-beta stocks less likely. Differences in uncertainty-related beta trading activities between mutual fund investors/managers and hedge funds support this explanation. Variation of the beta anomaly within the low-uncertainty state further corroborates it: the anomaly is significant (insignificant) in stocks heavily held by actively managed mutual funds (hedge funds), and it is concentrated in the subperiods in which leverage constraints for long-only investors are likely to be more severe.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper robustly connects observed portfolio choices to correlations of individual income shocks with an aggregate shock (or, equivalently, with stock market returns). The share of nonparticipating individuals displaying a positive correlation, and therefore a negative hedging demand for stocks, is above 79% in both our samples. Furthermore, correlations predict nonparticipation to the equity market, also out-of-sample and for the same individual over time. These results support the traditional hedging motive explanation for nonparticipation. Such new insight owes to the income shocks comovements across individuals, which we model and exploit to identify correlations. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Because of various factors (such as a lack of adequate statistical knowledge or data, unforeseen weather events), the yields of agricultural products often exhibit a high level of ambiguity. When facing distributional ambiguity in yields, farmers and landowners may base their contracting decisions on descriptive statistics, such as the mean and variance. To investigate how limited information could reshape optimal contract forms, we consider an agricultural supply chain in which a landowner contributes farmland and a skilled farmer exerts costly private effort to cultivate a crop. Both parties face distributional ambiguity in crop yield and employ a robust max-min decision rule. When the landowner possesses the bargaining power to draft the contract (the L model), we find that a hybrid contract of debt and equity is robustly optimal. In contrast, when the farmer possesses the bargaining power (the F model), the optimal contract could be a linear (equity) contract or a nonlinear quadratic debt contract, depending on the coefficient of variation (CV) and the landowner’s reservation profit. We use U.S. Department of Agriculture data to calibrate the model and find that, as the CV increases, the party that possesses the bargaining power tends to share more risk. We also find that when both the CV and the landowner’s reservation profit are sufficiently large, the L model induces a higher effort level; otherwise, the F model achieves better effort. Finally, we extend the model to consider various features, such as random crop price, farmer’s risk aversion and bounded crop yield. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Delay in negotiations is common in many settings, but the effects of delay have rarely been studied empirically in the field. We measure the causal effects of delay on bargaining outcomes using data from millions of negotiations on eBay. We find that for both buyers and sellers, the longer the bargaining party delays, the less likely the opponent is to continue the negotiation by countering, and the fewer rounds the negotiation takes to complete. The effects of delay are robust; they exist even under short amounts of delay (under six hours) and for negotiations for low-priced goods. We find that these effects are consistent with models of strategic delay, in which delay acts as a signal of bargaining power. This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Algorithmic advice has the potential to significantly improve human decision‐making, especially in dynamic and complex tasks that require a balance between exploration and exploitation. This study examines conditions under which individuals are willing to accept advice from algorithms in such scenarios, focusing on the interaction between participants&#39; exploration preferences and those of the advising algorithm. In an online experiment, we designed reinforcement learning algorithms to prioritize either exploration or exploitation and observed participants&#39; decision‐making behavior, modeled using a cognitive framework analogous to the algorithm. Contrary to expectations, participants did not show a preference for algorithms that matched their own exploration tendencies. In particular, participants were more likely to follow the advice of exploitative, consistent algorithms, possibly interpreting consistency as an indicator of competence. Although the participants benefited from the advice of the exploratory algorithm, their reluctance to follow it, regardless of whether the recommendation had been ignored previously or not, highlights a potential challenge in promoting effective collaboration between humans and algorithms. Explorative algorithms have the potential to promote behavioral diversification, but this effect is negated when humans disregard their advice. In such cases, algorithmic guidance can unintentionally decrease behavioral diversity by reinforcing established patterns.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Many real‐world social dilemmas require interdependent people to repeatedly protect against a large loss that has a low probability of occurring. Examples include protecting against disease outbreak (e.g., COVID‐19), terrorism (shared border security), or extreme weather events (from climate change). Decisions on whether to invest in protection may be made period by period (e.g., month by month), or investment may be precommitted in advance for a number of periods. How does precommitment influence cooperation in these situations? A series of four studies (plus one supplemental study) investigates this question, using incentive‐compatible, repeated social dilemmas with large‐magnitude, low‐probability losses. These studies found that in stochastic social dilemmas, binding precommitment increases cooperation, but nonbinding precommitment has little effect, and in deterministic social dilemmas, binding precommitment decreases cooperation. These patterns were driven by changes in responsiveness to probabilities and interactions with counterparts, with implications for how to structure real‐world dilemmas to increase cooperative investment in protection.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Using field and laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that the complexity of incentive schemes and worker bounded rationality can affect effort provision. This is because some attributes of the incentives become opaque; that is, workers do not take them into account. In our setting, workers overprovide effort relative to a fully rational benchmark, improving efficiency. We identify contract features, and facets of worker cognitive ability, that matter for opacity. We find that even relatively small degrees of opacity can cause large shifts in behavior. Our results illustrate important implications of complexity and bounded rationality for designing and regulating workplace incentive contracts. (JEL C90, D21, D91, J22, J31, J41)</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Consider an economy with equal amounts of N types of goods, to be allocated to agents with strict quasi-convex preferences over lotteries. We show that ex ante, all Pareto-efficient allocations give almost all agents lotteries over at most two outcomes. Our results provide a simple criterion showing that many popular allocation mechanisms are ex ante inefficient. For the case of identical preferences, we establish existence of an efficient solution where all lotteries used are equally attractive. Assuming the reduction axiom, social welfare deteriorates by first randomizing over these binary lotteries. Efficient ex ante equality is achieved if agents satisfy the compound-independence axiom.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In a recognition memory task, correct &quot;old&quot; responses to previously studied target items (hits) trigger larger pupil dilation (PD) than correct &quot;new&quot; responses to previously not presented foil items (correct rejections). This pupil old/new effect reflects the specific processes involved in recognition decisions, with dilation being larger when decisions are based on recollection of contextual details rather than mere familiarity. However, previous research has been limited in determining the exact link between PD and recognition processes due to the categorical nature of tasks used to assess recollection/familiarity. To investigate this issue, we examined whether the precision of the recollected memory representation is related to PD during successful recognition. During encoding, target words were presented on the outline of an invisible circle, and during a subsequent recognition task, participants made old/new decisions. For &quot;old&quot; responses, participants had to indicate the exact location of the target on the outline of the invisible circle. We found that larger PD during the old/new decision was related to more precise subsequent localization decision. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PD and memory precision are linearly related, and even hits followed by unprecise source localization trigger larger PD than correct rejections. Thus, increased PD is present for all recognition decisions, but its magnitude increases with increasing precision of source recollection. This pattern of results suggests that the pupil old/new effect might originate from two distinct components: The first is related to the mere recognition of a word, whereas the second reflects the quality of recollected source information.
