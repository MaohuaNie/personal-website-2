                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Making a decision and reporting your confidence in the accuracy of that decision are thought to be driven by the same mechanism: the accumulation of evidence. It is well known that choices and reaction times are well accounted for by a computational model assuming noisy accumulation of evidence until crossing a decision boundary (e.g., the drift diffusion model). Decision confidence can be derived from the amount of evidence following postdecision evidence accumulation. Currently, the stopping rule for postdecision evidence accumulation is underspecified. In the current work, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare the ability of five prominent models of confidence couched within evidence accumulation to account for this stopping rule. We collected data for two experiments in which participants were instructed to make fast or accurate decisions and to give fast or carefully considered confidence judgments. We then compared the different models in their ability to capture the speed-accuracy effects on confidence. Both at the quantitative and the qualitative level, the data were best accounted for by our newly proposed flexible confidence boundary model, in which postdecision accumulation terminates once it reaches one of two opposing slowly collapsing confidence boundaries. Inspection of the parameters of this model revealed that instructing participants to make fast versus accurate decisions influenced the height of the decision boundaries, while instructing participants to make fast versus careful confidence judgments influenced the height of the confidence boundaries. Our data show that the stopping rule for confidence judgments can be well described as an accumulation-to-bound process, and that the height of these confidence boundaries is under strategic control.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Transitivity of preference (ToP) is a central axiom of rational choice theory. While violating ToP is rare and subject to debate, there have been reports of such violations (Tsetsos et al., 2016a; Tversky, 1969, but see Iverson &amp; Falmagne, 1985; Regenwetter et al., 2011). If humans indeed violate ToP, an important challenge is understanding the conditions and mechanisms that promote either transitive or intransitive preferences. Here, we report the presence of ToP violations using a data analysis method that was prescribed as statistically adequate (Regenwetter et al., 2011), and an experimental design where each choice is presented on a single visual display to avoid artifacts that can be associated with sequential presentation and aggregation across choice stimuli. We introduce two cognitive heuristics that predict certain violations of ToP and we translate them into probabilistic choice models. Then, in three experiments (one of which is a preregistered replication), we evaluate violations of ToP and we assess the models that predict such violations. We find that, despite pervasive individual differences, the ToP adherence rate is much enhanced when the task was presented in a fashion that facilitates within-alternative integration. We also find that the proposed heuristic models successfully explain those ToP violations that do occur. These findings shed light on the conditions and cognitive mechanisms that support ToP.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">One of the most common method of eliciting false memories in the laboratory is the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995), where participants study a set of items that are all similar to a nonpresented critical lure. A common finding is that false recognition to critical lures is much higher than to other nonpresented items and in some cases is even comparable to true recognition, regardless of whether similarity is semantic or structural (e.g., phonological or orthographic) relations. While there exists a handful of computational models of this paradigm, they have only been applied to semantic but not structural false recognition, they have not been fit at the level of individual participants, and they have not been applied to response times. We present a global matching model that addresses all three of these current gaps. Global similarity of semantic and structural representations drives a pair of linear ballistic accumulators, which are used to produce decisions as well as complete response time distributions. In addition to being able to account for heightened false recognition of critical lures, the model was able to account for differences across both individual participants and items, lower correlations between semantic and structural false recognition than true recognition, differences in false recognition across levels of processing, improved true recognition but not false recognition with higher study time, and heightened false recognition under speed emphasis. The model suggests that semantic and structural false recognition can be explained using only a single retrieval mechanism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025Meta-reasoning studies investigate the role of metacognitive processes in monitoring the success likelihood of an ongoing Reasoning task expected to require Longer Deliberation Time (RLDT), and accordingly, control further cognitive resource allocation to maximize success likelihood. A Meta-reasoning study may require participants to report their intermediate confidence judgment repeatedly within RLDT, e.g., a response that I am 70% confident that the problem is solvable, requested every 15 s. Based on existing Meta-reasoning studies, the current study first identified a set of observable Meta-reasoning phenomena on how intermediate confidence judgment evolves within RLDT and its impact on response choice and response time. Then, based on identified Meta-reasoning phenomena, certain computational features, serving as guidelines, were proposed to facilitate the construction and evaluation of random walk models describing these phenomena. The Markov Random-Walk formulation of the Drift-Diffusion Model (MR-DDM) and the Quantum Random-Walk Model (QRM) have been widely utilized to model response choice, response time, and intermediate and final confidence judgments in decision-making studies. Hence, the proposed computational features were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of existing MR-DDM and QRM in describing meta-reasoning processes. Also, potential extensions of MR-DDM and QRM were identified for further empirical investigations. The current study also briefly reviewed an existing Item Response Theory (IRT) based extension of a continuous state continuous time Drift-Diffusion Model, named Q-Diffusion, that has been utilized to model RLDT without explicitly constraining the model to describe Meta-reasoning phenomena. Utilizing insights from Q-Diffusion and proposed computational features, the current study identified potential extensions of the MR-DDM for further empirical investigations.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025We propose a comprehensive model of how experiences are encoded and retrieved from memory. At the core of the model is a dynamic retrieval process incorporating two essential mechanisms: iterative retrieval, whereby information is sequentially sampled from memory to access the full history of experiences; and competitive retrieval, whereby the most prominent features in memory inhibit the recollection of other features. Together with context-based encoding, the model quantitatively explains well-known facts about response order and inter-response times in recall experiments. We show that our retrieval process maps closely to existing decision frameworks, such as drift–diffusion models, suggesting that the memory system plays a fundamental role in a wide-ranging set of decision-making settings.</span>

We derive the optimal solution to this problem and use this solution to evaluate the choices that people make when presented with decisions that have this multiplicative structure. Our participants (total N=2,072) are appropriately sensitive to how responsive a risk is to investment, but are conservative in their decisions and do not allocate enough resources to risks with lower probability of survival. This pattern persists even with alternative framings that emphasize survival probabilities. Our results highlight a systematic flaw in people&#39;s intuitions about how to respond to existential risks, and suggest that people may have particular difficulty with decisions that involve multiplicative objectives.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025The uncertainty of a point estimate, often conceptualized and quantified via a prediction interval, can vary in both magnitude (e.g., width) and symmetry. Further, when people make many types of estimates, they can use different but equitable metrics (e.g., feet vs. meters). In a series of experiments, we investigate whether using different metrics impacts people&#39;s estimates of uncertainty. Three empirical regularities guide our focus: First, people believe risk scales with magnitude, reporting greater uncertainty for bigger point estimates, leading to inconsistent prediction intervals across metrics differing by a fixed additive constant. Second, people are insufficiently sensitive to unit changes, leading to inconsistent prediction interval widths across metrics differing by a multiplicative constant. Third, people tend to assume that distributions are symmetric, leading to inconsistent symmetry across metrics differing by an inverse transformation. Together, these three regularities exemplify how uncertainty estimations are sensitive to metric in substantive ways.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024While the motivation to gather accurate information emerges early in childhood, social motivations can modulate the drive for accuracy. Across two studies we investigate how social narratives can impact the efficiency of information search in children (6–14 years old), adolescents (14–17 years old), and adults. Work investigating the developmental trajectory of information-search strategies has found that efficiency begins to improve dramatically at age 3, and that children as young as 2 are able to tailor their search strategies to their environments to maximize information gain. In the presented studies (n = 174; n = 175), participants are told they are competing in a sporting event and that their team is either winning or losing. Participants are then tasked with playing a 20-Questions game to try to find a culprit guilty of foul play, and told that if they are not found the competition will be canceled. Whether the participant&#39;s team is winning or losing determines whether their team would benefit from finding the culprit. As hypothesized, we found that participants from all age groups searched more efficiently when finding the culprit was in their best interest. Our findings suggest that social contexts play a crucial role in modulating the efficiency of information search across age groups, particularly in comparison to their performance on a standard 20-Questions game, highlighting the importance of taking social contexts into account when designing new paradigms and tracing the developmental trajectory of children&#39;s information search strategies in lab settings and the real world. Public significance statement: This work highlights how our environments shape our motivations as we engage with information. Specifically, it examines how our beliefs and our social contexts influence what information we search for and how much of it we gather. In today&#39;s media landscape, where content reflects every conceivable viewpoint, it is essential to recognize how our interactions with information are influenced by our contexts. Making sense of these relationships is key to grasping how sources and content platforms shape our behavior with regard to what and how we search.</span>

We conduct two online experiments to challenge this perception. In our first experiment, we show that recent prominent experimental findings in support of salience-predicted correlation effects were driven by changes in the display format rather than the salience of payoffs: (i) salience effects vanish when controlling for simultaneous changes in the display format when varying the correlation structure; (ii) choice patterns previously attributed to the salience mechanism can be induced by keeping the correlation structure constant and simply varying the display format. In our second experiment, we find that, in a contest between display format and salience effects, the former are quantitatively more important than the latter. In a setup allowing the investigation of correlation effects in the absence of confounding changes in the display format, we are unable to detect significant salience-predicted correlation effects.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Algorithmic advice has the potential to significantly improve human decision‐making, especially in dynamic and complex tasks that require a balance between exploration and exploitation. This study examines conditions under which individuals are willing to accept advice from algorithms in such scenarios, focusing on the interaction between participants&#39; exploration preferences and those of the advising algorithm. In an online experiment, we designed reinforcement learning algorithms to prioritize either exploration or exploitation and observed participants&#39; decision‐making behavior, modeled using a cognitive framework analogous to the algorithm. Contrary to expectations, participants did not show a preference for algorithms that matched their own exploration tendencies. In particular, participants were more likely to follow the advice of exploitative, consistent algorithms, possibly interpreting consistency as an indicator of competence. Although the participants benefited from the advice of the exploratory algorithm, their reluctance to follow it, regardless of whether the recommendation had been ignored previously or not, highlights a potential challenge in promoting effective collaboration between humans and algorithms. Explorative algorithms have the potential to promote behavioral diversification, but this effect is negated when humans disregard their advice. In such cases, algorithmic guidance can unintentionally decrease behavioral diversity by reinforcing established patterns.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Many real‐world social dilemmas require interdependent people to repeatedly protect against a large loss that has a low probability of occurring. Examples include protecting against disease outbreak (e.g., COVID‐19), terrorism (shared border security), or extreme weather events (from climate change). Decisions on whether to invest in protection may be made period by period (e.g., month by month), or investment may be precommitted in advance for a number of periods. How does precommitment influence cooperation in these situations? A series of four studies (plus one supplemental study) investigates this question, using incentive‐compatible, repeated social dilemmas with large‐magnitude, low‐probability losses. These studies found that in stochastic social dilemmas, binding precommitment increases cooperation, but nonbinding precommitment has little effect, and in deterministic social dilemmas, binding precommitment decreases cooperation. These patterns were driven by changes in responsiveness to probabilities and interactions with counterparts, with implications for how to structure real‐world dilemmas to increase cooperative investment in protection.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Psychological theories are often expressed verbally using natural language, which may lead to varying interpretations of the phenomenon under study. This potential confusion can be mitigated by formalizing verbal theories using mathematical language, which can help in defining, analyzing, and interpreting one&#39;s hypotheses in quantitative terms. Differential equations (DEs) are a class of models in the dynamical systems framework, particularly suited to many dynamic theories in psychology. However, there is a lack of tools for translating verbal theories into DE systems. To facilitate this translation, we introduce SimDE (https://simde.ucdavis.edu/), an open-access R Shiny application that allows users to specify a DE model and then simulate the trajectories of each variable over time. SimDE provides an interface to simulate a range of DE models, with features such as: (a) first- or second-order DEs (e.g., exponential, oscillatory), (b) models with or without a dynamic error term (ordinary or stochastic DEs), (c) models with coupling dynamics. Users have the flexibility of plotting these systems in order to see the pattern of changes over time and determine the appropriateness of the model for the phenomenon they are trying to study. The goal of our app is to serve as a tool for researchers who want to explore DE models for their psychological theories before they even collect data. It can also help researchers to study the implicit assumptions of their systems defined with such DEs and further refine them as needed.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Learning traps are cycles of suboptimal decision making where a false belief about the structure of the environment leads to avoidance of rewarding options. Two experiments ( N = 324) examined the role of selective attention in the emergence and prevention of learning traps. Participants learned to approach or avoid members of two categories that were associated with either gains or losses. A rule involving two visual feature dimensions predicted category membership, while a third dimension was irrelevant. Category feedback was provided only when an item was approached. Selective attention during learning was assessed using an eye tracker. Experiment 1 found that many participants fell into the trap of using a single-dimension rule to guide approach/avoid decisions and consequently missed rewards. Eye tracking confirmed that these participants narrowed their visual attention to a single dimension. In Experiment 2, attention to multiple exemplar features was increased by adding a salient visual highlighting cue. When only predictive features were highlighted, trap prevalence was reduced. A key finding was that shifts in selective attention always occurred at the same time or after formation of beliefs about category structure, indicating the causal primacy of such beliefs in trap formation.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Pavlovian biases are patterns of behavior that involve approaching stimuli associated with reward and avoiding those associated with punishment (regardless of whether this is actually optimal behavior). They are a ubiquitous feature of everyday decision making and are also believed to play an important role in the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although Pavlovian biases have classically been described as fixed and automatic, some studies have indicated that their influence on behavior can actually vary over time and with task demands. While these results hint that people may have some control over their Pavlovian biases, direct behavioral evidence for this control is still lacking. In a preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled study ( N = 800), we tested whether a week-long cognitive training intervention could reduce Pavlovian biases on the orthogonalized go/no-go task, a well-established paradigm for isolating Pavlovian-instrumental conflict. Participants were trained on either high-conflict or no-conflict conditions of the task across 5 days. Using reinforcement learning models to dissociate components of decision making, we found that high-conflict training led to a significant reduction in Pavlovian bias-particularly avoidance bias-at follow-up. This result is incompatible with the view that Pavlovian biases are fixed and automatic, and instead implies much greater flexibility in the way that they influence cognition than has previously been understood. The training was kept deliberately simple (i.e., one stimulus per condition, with the correct responses kept constant over sessions) so as to provide a minimal proof of concept of whether Pavlovian biases can be reduced through training, but as a result, we did not observe transfer to other tasks or self-reported mood. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that targeted cognitive training can modulate Pavlovian biases, which may be beneficial both in everyday life and especially in the context of affective disorders like anxiety and depression.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Using field and laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that the complexity of incentive schemes and worker bounded rationality can affect effort provision. This is because some attributes of the incentives become opaque; that is, workers do not take them into account. In our setting, workers overprovide effort relative to a fully rational benchmark, improving efficiency. We identify contract features, and facets of worker cognitive ability, that matter for opacity. We find that even relatively small degrees of opacity can cause large shifts in behavior. Our results illustrate important implications of complexity and bounded rationality for designing and regulating workplace incentive contracts. (JEL C90, D21, D91, J22, J31, J41)</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Visual working memory (VWM) performance fluctuates from moment to moment with occasional failures in maintaining accurate information in mind. While previous research suggests that individuals tend to be overconfident in their VWM performance during these failures, no study to date has examined whether individuals can predict upcoming reductions in VWM performance. To test the accuracy of both prospective and retrospective awareness on VWM performance, we developed a VWM bet task in which participants made trial-by-trial bets on their upcoming VWM performance prior to viewing a memory array of colored squares, followed by color reports paired with confidence ratings at test. Across two experiments ( N = 87; N = 85), we demonstrate that retrospective awareness is more sensitive to VWM performance fluctuations than prospective awareness in young adults, though both metacognitive abilities are imperfect. Poor metacognitive abilities reflected a general tendency-particularly among low VWM capacity individuals-to overestimate upcoming VWM performance. When individuals overestimated their upcoming VWM performance (i.e., prospective failures), VWM performance significantly reduced compared to the preceding trials of a prospective failure. Moreover, this reduction in performance significantly lingered into subsequent trials. However, individuals&#39; prospective and retrospective awareness better aligned to VWM performance after a prospective failure. This postfailure calibration occurred even without feedback signaling a prospective failure (Experiment 2), suggesting a metacognitive efficiency in recognizing the initial overestimation. Taken together, our results suggest that individuals, particularly low-capacity individuals, have a limited awareness toward upcoming VWM performance but exhibit metacognitive adjustments immediately following a prospective failure.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Can algorithms help people detect deception in high-stakes strategic interactions? Participants watching the preplay communication of contestants in the TV show Golden Balls display a limited ability to predict contestants’ behavior, whereas algorithms do significantly better. To increase participants’ accuracy, we provide them with algorithmic advice by flagging videos for which an algorithm predicts a high likelihood of cooperation or defection. We test how the effectiveness of flags depends on their timing. We show that participants rely significantly more on flags shown before they watch the videos than flags shown after they watch them. These findings show that the timing of algorithmic feedback is key for its adoption. This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We uncover a significant friction in small business lending: perception of risk by Small Business Administration (SBA) employees. Using novel data on SBA employees transferring across offices, we find that more current defaults on SBA loans in their previous location reduce SBA loans and job creation in their current location. The effect is independent of local economic conditions and the informational content of the nonlocal defaults, suggesting that SBA employees update their risk assessment irrationally. Our results are the first to document that regulators’ misperception of economic conditions affects the ability of small businesses to obtain access to finance.
