                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Although listeners may have the competence to engage in a word-by-word analysis to build a syntactic representation of a heard sentence, in everyday conversation, listeners may, almost by necessity, process the sentence only to a shallow or “good enough” level to derive its meaning. The possibility has been raised that processing schemata may be flexible, such that under some circumstances, comprehension decisions are more likely to be based on an incomplete analysis. We report two experiments in which adult participants were tested on their ability to determine the meaning of auditorily presented plausible or implausible sentences. In both experiments, participants were given two different orienting instructions while completing the listening task (instructions that emphasized either the speed or accuracy of the comprehension decision). In Experiment 1, we also manipulated spectral clarity such that speech was either heard clearly or degraded in spectral richness. A unique use of hierarchical drift–diffusion modeling was employed to probe latent decision-making processes that influenced the participants’ comprehension decision. Results indicate that orienting instructions that emphasize speed and perceptual challenge both increase the likelihood that the assumed meaning of implausible sentences will be based on plausibility. Drift–diffusion modeling revealed a dissociation where orienting instructions selectively influenced the amount of evidence required for the participant to make a comprehension decision while sentence plausibility selectively influenced the rate of evidence accumulation. These drift–diffusion model findings were replicated in Experiment 2. Results suggest that comprehension processes are highly flexible and can be characterized in terms of underlying decision-making mechanisms.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">A longstanding focus in the causal learning literature has been on inferring causal relations from contingencies, where these abstract away from time by collating independent instances or by aggregating over regularly demarcated trials. In contrast, individual causal learners encounter events in their daily lives that occur in a continuous temporal flow with no such demarcation. Consequently, the process of learning causal relationships in naturalistic environments is comparatively less understood. In this article, we lay out a rational framework that foregrounds the role of time in causal learning. We work within the Bayesian rational analysis tradition, starting by considering how causal relations induce dependence between events in continuous time and how this can be modeled by stochastic processes from the Poisson-Gamma distribution family. We derive the qualitative signatures of causal influence and the general computations needed to infer structure from temporal patterns. We show that this rational account can parsimoniously explain the human preference for causal models that invoke shorter, more reliable, and more predictable causal influences. Furthermore, we show this provides a unifying explanation for human judgments across a wide variety of tasks in the reanalysis of seven experimental data sets. We anticipate the framework will help researchers better understand the many manifestations of continuous-time causal learning across human cognition and the tasks that probe it, from explicit causal structure induction settings to implicit associative or reinforcement learning settings.
