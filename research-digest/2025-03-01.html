                  <span style="color:#374151;">Failing to follow expert advice can have real and dangerous consequences. While any number of factors may lead a decision maker to refuse expert advice, the proliferation of algorithmic experts has further complicated the issue. One potential mechanism that restricts the acceptance of expert advice is betrayal aversion, or the strong dislike for the violation of trust norms. This study explores whether the introduction of expert algorithms in place of human experts can attenuate betrayal aversion and lead to higher overall rates of seeking expert advice. In other words, we ask: are decision makers averse to algorithmic betrayal? The answer to this question is uncertain ex ante. We answer this question through an experimental financial market where there is an identical risk of betrayal from either a human or algorithmic financial advisor. We find that the willingness to delegate to human experts is significantly reduced by betrayal aversion, while no betrayal aversion is exhibited toward algorithmic experts. The impact of betrayal aversion toward financial advisors is considerable: the resulting unwillingness to take the advice of the human expert leads to a 20% decrease in subsequent earnings, while no loss in earnings is observed in the algorithmic expert condition. This study has significant implications for firms, policymakers, and consumers, specifically in the financial services industry. This paper has been This paper was accepted by D. J.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In this study, we investigated human causal learning in a continuous time and space setting. We find participants to be capable active causal structure learners, and with the help of computational modeling explore how they mitigate the complexity of continuous dynamics data to achieve this. We propose that participants combine systematic interventions with a narrowed focus on causal dynamics that occur during and directly downstream of their interventions. This task decomposition approach achieves comparable accuracy to attending to all the dynamics, while discarding almost half of the data. We argue this strategy makes sense from a resource rationality perspective: Ignoring dynamics outside of interventions saves computational cost while the interventions naturally decompose the global learning problem into a series of more manageable subproblems. We also find that when the causal relata are given real-world labels, participants will use their domain-specific priors to guide their structure inferences. In particular, individuals with accurate prior expectations were less likely to make the common local computations error of mistaking an indirect for a direct relationship. Overall, our experiments reinforce the idea that humans are frugal and intuitive active learners who combine actions and inference to optimize learning while minimizing effort.
