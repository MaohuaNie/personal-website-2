                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT People often exhibit systematic differences in their risky choices when decisions elicit high anticipatory affect compared to choices that are relatively affect‐poor—typically showing lower decision quality and greater risk aversion. This affect gap can be modeled by assuming that people use a compensatory strategy (i.e., a strategy that weighs outcomes against their probability of occurring) in affect‐poor choices, but a simple non‐compensatory strategy that considers outcome but ignores probability information in affect‐rich choices. The reasons for this difference in strategy selection, however, are not yet understood. To examine whether the affect gap may reflect that in affect‐rich choices, cognitive resources are more strongly taxed (leading to a simplification of the underlying decision strategy), we investigated whether the affect gap is impacted by a time pressure manipulation. Participants were asked to choose between affect‐rich prospects (medical lotteries) and economically equivalent but relatively affect‐poor prospects (monetary lotteries), either without a time constraint or under time pressure. The results indicated that the affect gap manifested similarly under time pressure as without time pressure. Specifically, differences between affect‐rich and affect‐poor choices in strategy selection did not differ between time pressure conditions, and differences in decision quality and risk aversion were even slightly attenuated under time pressure. The findings suggest that the differences in decision behavior between affect‐rich and affect‐poor choices are not driven by cognitive constraints. We discuss the potential psychological mechanisms involved in the affect gap.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Research on intuition often produces conflicting results and suffers from reliability issues due to the lack of tools that can conclusively evaluate a person&#39;s latent intuitive position. It has been recently proposed that a decision maker&#39;s intuitive position can be evaluated by estimating parameters with sequential sampling models (SSMs), which provide a biologically plausible framework to measure how intuition affects decisions. In two studies, we use the drift diffusion model (DDM), as a type of SSM, to investigate topics where intuition is difficult to evaluate. In Study 1, we used the DDM to examine how the cognitive reflection test (CRT) scores relate to intuition in risky decision making and found that individuals with high CRT scores had superior performance and relied more on intuition. These findings challenge the conventional view that high CRT scores imply less reliance on intuition and that intuition is detrimental to decision performance. In Study 2, we examined the cross‐domain stability of the preference for intuition and found that decision makers rely more on intuition in the social decision domain than in the risky decision domain and that these measures are not correlated across the two domains. The evidence for this unstable preference has hitherto primarily resulted from self‐reports, which have a questionable ability to assess the preference for intuition. In both studies, we demonstrate that the DDM can accurately simulate the decision outcome and decision time patterns that are affected by intuition, providing evidence for the usefulness of DDM analysis in the study of intuition.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Biases are prevalent in human judgment and decision‐making (JDM). Previous research has suggested that some biases might share common underlying causes and can be accounted for under dual‐process theories in which fast and error‐prone System 1 drives erroneous behavior. Here, we use an online paradigm to investigate similarities and differences in behavior across three commonly studied cognitive bias phenomena: cognitive reflection test (CRT), gambler&#39;s fallacy (GF), and conjunction fallacy (CF). These are all thought to emerge during biased System 1 processing. Critically, we examine both summative performance metrics and process tracing measures derived from mouse cursor movements and growth curve analysis (GCA). Summative performance in these tasks was broadly in line with previous studies, and we replicated correlations in accuracy between tasks (CRT vs. CF and CRT vs. GF). However, we found key differences in our GCA of mouse trajectories. Specifically, in the CRT and the CF tasks, participants tended to choose the incorrect option more quickly relative to the correct option, as might be expected. However, the opposite tendency was observed for GF—people tended to take longer to choose the wrong answer. We also found evidence from the mouse movement analyses for between‐task differences in the extent to which participants were tempted by the option they did not choose. These findings challenge prominent dual‐process accounts of JDM and highlight the potential of process tracing (and in particular mouse movement analyses) for revealing insights into cognitive processes.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Reyna, Reed, Meschkow, Calderon, and Helm experimentally extend to plea bargaining in criminal cases findings from numerous other behavioral contexts that how the bargain is framed affects decisions reached. Framing effects undermine the presumption among many in the law that plea decisions will be rational and made “in the shadow of trial.” This is an important extension of the psychological literature. However, given the complexity of the process of plea bargaining, and in particular, the fact that it is controlled by the prosecutor, involves bargaining with counsel, is done in secret, and there are few restrictions, the practical import of framing effects for reforming plea bargains is doubtful. Nonetheless, given that plea bargaining privileges efficiency over truth, the additional principle of fairness is too often missing from the plea bargain literature. Reyna et al. usefully bring that fundamental concern back into focus.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT This study examines whether monetary priming increases children&#39;s cheating and moderates the effect of prize attractiveness on their cheating behavior. While rational economic theory suggests that individuals cheat more when incentives are greater, previous findings have been inconsistent. We propose that monetary priming could explain these mixed results, hypothesizing that it may not only increase cheating but also influence sensitivity to reward magnitude. We conducted a quasi‐experimental study in which children (7–10 years old, N = 178) were primed (or not) with money (real or symbolic money) before participating in a “roll a die” task that determined the number of rewards they could obtain. This task utilized an electronic die (DICE+), which enabled us to identify both actual and self‐reported values of die rolls. As expected, monetary priming (both real and symbolic) increased cheating among the children. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that while participants were more inclined to cheat for more attractive prizes in non‐monetary priming conditions, they became insensitive to the attractiveness of potential gains after monetary priming. These findings suggest that monetary priming may activate a business decision frame in which rewards of any size can prompt action, and proportionality is not taken into account. Our results may help explain inconsistencies in previous studies on the relationship between incentives and cheating, suggesting that unintentional monetary priming (e.g., through monetary incentives) in some experiments could mask the effects of reward size.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">For standard preferences under uncertainty, minimal requirements are proposed to identify cardinal utility and subjective, potentially nonadditive, beliefs. This is achieved through an application of betting consistency. This preference principle says that outcome midpoints derived from preferences over bets on an event are also midpoints when elicited from bets on a different event. This consistency requirement provides a simplified elicitation tool, while it also serves as a robustness test for utility measurements. An analyst can use betting consistency to identify a client’s cardinal utility index independent of the client’s beliefs. This follows from our simplified foundation for the biseparable utility model, the widely adopted framework for empirical measurements of utility under various sources of uncertainty. As a theoretical tool, betting consistency can be adopted to provide simple and intuitive foundations for new and for existing decision theories. For instance, an event-dependent version of betting consistency, if it is supplemented with Savage’s sure-thing principle or a version of that principle restricted to acts that satisfy Schmeidler’s comonotonicity property, delivers subjective expected utility or Choquet expected utility, as desired. We also demonstrate how models with specific nonadditive beliefs can easily be derived through bespoke formulations of betting consistency.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Committees of experts are widely used to make decisions. We experimentally investigate the relationship between decision making in committees and the assessment of the ability of committee members by evaluators, comparing observed behavior with theoretical predictions. Treatments vary in whether members care only about a state-dependent project payoff or also about assessments and whether evaluators can base their assessments only on the decision the committee makes or also on cheap-talk statements made by committee members on their confidence in the committee decision. Evidence for the equilibrium predictions is mixed; for example, contrary to theory, committees with a concern for their assessment do not distort their decisions more than committees without, whereas in line with theory, evaluators give higher assessments to committees that take the risky decision rather than the riskless. We analyze whether evaluators rationally base their assessments on observed behavior of committees using an orthogonality test. In treatments with cheap-talk statements, assessments are quite rational; in treatments without, they are too low on average. We investigate whether committees best reply to expected project payoffs and, in treatments in which members’ payoffs also depend on assessments, to predicted assessments conditional on observed committee behavior. In all treatments, committees respond to the possibilities to raise expected payoffs but do not use them as much as predicted by theory. We conclude by showing that the amount of information about committee members’ abilities that ends up in assessments is considerably larger when evaluators observe committees’ decisions and statements rather than only decisions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Most research on systemic stability assumes an economy where banks are subject to exogenous shocks. However, in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. I show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: the risk exposure choices made by connected banks are strategically complementary. Banks within financial networks, especially densely connected ones, become endogenously exposed to excessive risks. The theory offers several novel perspectives on policy debates. For instance, it suggests that limiting government bailouts to interbank exposures can effectively reduce endogenous systemic risk. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study the behavioral effects of process automation on human workers interacting with automated tasks. We introduce a stylized normative model with two workers who complete their tasks sequentially, working toward a joint project to obtain a fixed payment plus a variable bonus that depends on how early the project is completed. The normative model prescribes that, if workers are fully rational, they will complete their tasks as soon as possible if the early completion bonus is high enough. However, following the literature, we hypothesize that workers will suboptimally delay project completion. Following the insights from a behavioral model, we further predict that automation will alleviate this problem by reducing strategic uncertainty, resulting in an indirect behavioral benefit of a higher worker productivity, in addition to the direct benefit of a higher project completion rate and a shorter project duration. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment replicating the theoretical model, varying (i) whether a worker collaborates with a coworker or a robot, and (ii) in the case of collaborating with a robot, whether the upstream or downstream task is the one automated. First, we find that workers largely deviate from the optimal policy, as they take longer than what the normative theory prescribes to complete their tasks or do not complete the project. Second, we show that process automation increases the project completion rate and reduces the project completion time, confirming the benefits of process automation. Interestingly, workers who collaborate with robots take longer to complete their tasks, contradicting our initial hypothesis that process automation has a positive effect on the productivity of human workers. In addition, we find that upstream automation is more beneficial than downstream automation. We also show that social preferences are an important driver of these results because prosocial subjects tend to be more productive when collaborating with a human coworker than with a robot. Finally, we show that our findings remain robust in a continuous processing setting. This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro for the Management Science Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Existing literature suggests that firms engage in misconduct in response to financial pressure. However, the extent and severity of misconduct have been challenging to determine given the lack of granular data. This limitation is particularly true for smaller firms in emerging markets whose profitability and survival depend on misconduct. This study analyzes the impact of reducing capital constraints on misconduct using high-frequency global positioning system and financing data from the minibus taxi industry in South Africa. I find that lower interest rates, a proxy for lower capital constraints, decrease the most severe forms of misconduct measured by the propensity to speed and crash yet leave more modest forms of misconduct unchanged. Qualitative interviews and survey data suggest that these results are attributable to firms’ efforts to avoid default. These findings contribute to understanding misconduct as a firm strategy when facing financial pressure and suggest that lower capital constraints might improve firm survival and public safety.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Human–algorithm collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent in the economy and society. However, this collaboration is not always fruitful, and in extreme cases, people become human borgs or totally averse to algorithms. The key to collaborative value is whether humans and algorithms can complement each other in decision making, but it is challenging for humans to disagree with algorithmic recommendations at the right time (i.e., to disagree when algorithms are wrong and not disagree when algorithms are right). To understand the centric role of disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration and examine when and how it benefits, we conducted a field experiment in which human evaluators and algorithms worked together to evaluate loan applications under four scenarios, that is, limited/rich information and with/without disclosure of algorithm rationale. Our results show that human–algorithm collaboration decisions outperformed human- or algorithm-only decisions, and these collaborative values varied across the four scenarios. We further propose a theoretical framework for mechanism examination that centers on the formation and effectiveness of disagreement. We validate the framework empirically and come to the following findings: (1) disagreement exhibits a sizable and nonlinear influence on collaborative value, (2) the differences between human evaluators and algorithms in decision making contribute to disagreement but not to collaborative value, (3) algorithm self-contradiction triggers disagreement and helps human evaluators disagree with algorithms at the right time. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights on how collaborative value is achieved and managerial insights on how to manage disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We examine the relation between temperature changes and firm performance using a novel time-varying measure of firm-level temperature sensitivity. We find that firms with higher temperature sensitivity have lower future profitability and riskier corporate policies. These firms are also overpriced and earn lower average future returns as market participants are slow to correct the mispricing. Nonlocal institutional investors allocate higher portfolio weights to firms with high temperature sensitivity, and sell-side equity analyst forecasts are less accurate for these firms. Together, these results suggest that financial markets underreact to information about firm-level temperature sensitivity, and this generates predictable patterns in returns. A trading strategy that exploits this mispricing generates an annualized risk-adjusted return of more than 4% during the 1968–2020 period. This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Weaning patients from mechanical ventilators is a crucial decision in intensive care units (ICUs), significantly affecting patient outcomes and the throughput of ICUs. This study aims to improve the current extubation protocols by incorporating predictive information on patient health conditions. We develop a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision process with predictions of future state to support extubation decisions. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and provide important insights into how predictive information can lead to different decision protocols. We demonstrate that adding predictive information is always beneficial, even if physicians place excessive trust in the predictions, as long as the predictive model is moderately accurate. Using a comprehensive data set from an ICU in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, we evaluate the effectiveness of various policies and demonstrate that incorporating predictive information can reduce ICU length of stay by up to 3.4% and, simultaneously, decrease the extubation failure rate by up to 20.3%, compared with the optimal policy that does not utilize prediction. These benefits are more significant for patients with poor initial conditions upon ICU admission. Both our analytical and numerical findings suggest that predictive information is particularly valuable in identifying patients who could benefit from continued intubation, thereby allowing for personalized and delayed extubation for these patients.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Data show that 72% of the earnings announcement premium is realized before, rather than after, earnings releases. We propose that uncertainty risk resolution before the announcement leads to large pre-announcement returns and test the uncertainty risk resolution hypothesis in the cross section. Compelling empirical evidence supports this hypothesis: an interquartile increase in the firm’s uncertainty level is associated with a 6.3% greater uncertainty reduction and 0.65% higher market-adjusted returns in the 10-day period before earnings announcements. We also provide evidence that there are two distinct channels for uncertainty risk resolution: information acquisition by investors and information supply by analysts and firm management.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We develop a parsimonious price formation model to study information aggregation and information acquisition in the presence of trading delays. If delays apply uniformly to uninformed and informed traders, the level of delays does not affect information aggregation. Traders’ information acquisition incentives are, however, weaker in a market with longer delays. Therefore, the equilibrium fraction of informed traders is lower if delays are longer, establishing an inverse relationship between trading delays and price informativeness. We also show that risk premia and price dispersion tend to be nonmonotonic functions of the level of delays when information acquisition is endogenous. We document novel empirical evidence from the UK corporate bond market, which largely corroborates the implications of our theory. This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">One of the most important challenges in decision theory has been how to reconcile the normative expectations from Bayesian theory with the apparent fallacies that are common in probabilistic reasoning. Recently, Bayesian models have been driven by the insight that apparent fallacies are due to sampling errors or biases in estimating (Bayesian) probabilities. An alternative way to explain apparent fallacies is by invoking different probability rules, specifically the probability rules from quantum theory. Arguably, quantum cognitive models offer a more unified explanation for a large body of findings, problematic from a baseline classical perspective. This work addresses two major corresponding theoretical challenges: first, a framework is needed which incorporates both Bayesian and quantum influences, recognizing the fact that there is evidence for both in human behavior. Second, there is empirical evidence which goes beyond any current Bayesian and quantum model. We develop a model for probabilistic reasoning, seamlessly integrating both Bayesian and quantum models of reasoning and augmented by a sequential sampling process, which maps subjective probabilistic estimates to observable responses. Our model, called the Quantum Sequential Sampler, is compared to the currently leading Bayesian model, the Bayesian Sampler (J. Zhu et al., 2020) using a new experiment, producing one of the largest data sets in probabilistic reasoning to this day. The Quantum Sequential Sampler embodies several new components, which we argue offer a more theoretically accurate approach to probabilistic reasoning. Moreover, our empirical tests revealed a new, surprising systematic overestimation of probabilities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">The efficient representation of visual information is essential for learning and decision making due to the complexity and uncertainty of the world, as well as inherent constraints on the capacity of cognitive systems. We hypothesize that biological agents learn to efficiently represent visual information in a manner that balances performance across multiple potentially competing objectives. In this article, we examine two such objectives: storing information in a manner that supports accurate recollection (maximizing veridicality) and in a manner that facilitates utility-based decision making (maximizing behavioral utility). That these two objectives may be in conflict is not immediately obvious. Our hypothesis suggests that neither behavior nor representation formation can be fully understood by studying either in isolation, with information processing constraints exerting an overarching influence. Alongside this hypothesis we develop a computational model of representation formation and behavior motivated by recent methods in machine learning and neuroscience. The resulting model explains both the beneficial aspects of human visual learning, such as fast acquisition and high generalization, as well as the biases that result from information constraints. To test this model, we developed two experimental paradigms, in decision making and learning, to evaluate how well the model&#39;s predictions match human behavior. A key feature of the proposed model is that it predicts the occurrence of commonly found biases in human decision making, resulting from the desire to form efficient representations of visual information that are useful for behavioral goals in learning and decision making and optimized under an information processing constraint.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">We conduct a field experiment with US households to study how expectations about long-run home price growth shape spending decisions. We exogenously vary survey respondents&#39; expectations by providing different expert forecasts. Homeowners&#39; spending, measured using rich home-scanner data, is inelastic to home price expectations. By contrast, renters reduce their spending when expecting higher home price growth. These patterns reflect positive wealth effects for owners from higher future wealth and negative income effects for both groups due to higher future housing costs. Our study highlights consequences of asset price growth and long-term expectations about the economy for household behavior. (JEL C93, D12, D84, D91, G51, R31)</span>
