                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsIn everyday life, people routinely make decisions that involve irredeemable risks such as death (e.g., while driving). Even though these decisions under extinction risk are common, practically important, and have different properties compared to the types of decisions typically studied by decision scientists, they have received little research attention. The present work advances the formal understanding of decision making under extinction risk by introducing a novel experimental paradigm, the Extinction Gambling Task (EGT). We derive optimal strategies for three different types of extinction and near-extinction events, and compare them to participants’ choices in three experiments. Leveraging computational modelling to describe strategies at the individual level, we document strengths and shortcomings in participants’ decisions under extinction risk. Specifically, we find that, while participants are relatively good in terms of the qualitative strategies they employ, their decisions are nevertheless affected by loss chasing, scope insensitivity, and opportunity cost neglect. We hope that by formalising decisions under extinction risk and providing a task to study them, this work will facilitate future research on an important topic that has been largely ignored.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025People often make judgments about uncertain facts and events, for example ‘Germany will win the world cup’. Judgment under uncertainty is often studied with reference to a normative ideal according to which people should make guesses that have a high probability of being correct. According to this normative ideal, you should say that Germany will win the world cup if you think that Germany is in fact likely to win. We argue that in many cases, judgment under uncertainty is instead best conceived of as an act of lossy compression, where the goal is to efficiently encode a probability distribution, rather than express the probability of a single outcome. We test formal computational models derived from our theory, showing in four experiments that they accurately predict how people make and interpret guesses. Our account naturally explains why people dislike vacuously-correct guesses (like ‘Some country will win the world cup’), and sheds light on apparently sub-optimal patterns of judgment such as the conjunction fallacy.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The Author(s)We can guide our decisions in novel situations by drawing on our past experiences (episodic memories). While at times we can retrieve relevant episodes via cued recall, other situations may require a process of memory search. But what mechanisms underlie this search? In this work we synthesize six key principles concerning the storage and retrieval of episodic memories, and build on these principles to propose a cognitive mechanism which allows for the retrieval of relevant past experiences through a process of cascading recall. In this process, observing a stimulus triggers the cued recall of a past event. If this memory does not provide sufficient information to warrant a decision, then it next reinstates all the memory&#39;s constituent features. These features then form the inputs to sample an additional memory in a subsequent recall step, which in turn reinstates its own features and so forth. This process continues until a suitable past experience is retrieved. We provide empirical support for key predictions of this cascading process through three online experiments in which participants interacted with unfamiliar stimuli. The results indicate that participants rely on cued recall of similar past experiences (experiment 1), and on indirectly related experiences when cued recall is not informative (experiment 2). Additionally, participants were substantially more likely to retrieve a predicted memory, and did so faster, when relying on cued recall versus cascadizng memory search (experiment 3). We conclude by discussing how this cascading recall process bridges several influential models of memory-based decision-making, as well as offering promising directions for future research.</span>

While these decisions have been widely studied, most research focuses on the final choice rather than the process leading to it. In this paper, we combine two process-tracing tools, eye-tracking and mouse cursor tracking, to observe how decisions unfold in real time. Across two incentive-compatible experiments, we find that both visual attention and mouse movements predict choice, and together they provide complementary, non-overlapping insights. These tools also reveal how seemingly minor factors, such as where information appears on a computer screen, can influence decisions. By capturing the dynamics of the decision-making process, this approach offers valuable implications for organizations aiming to better understand, predict, or shape behavior.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT People often exhibit systematic differences in their risky choices when decisions elicit high anticipatory affect compared to choices that are relatively affect‐poor—typically showing lower decision quality and greater risk aversion. This affect gap can be modeled by assuming that people use a compensatory strategy (i.e., a strategy that weighs outcomes against their probability of occurring) in affect‐poor choices, but a simple non‐compensatory strategy that considers outcome but ignores probability information in affect‐rich choices. The reasons for this difference in strategy selection, however, are not yet understood. To examine whether the affect gap may reflect that in affect‐rich choices, cognitive resources are more strongly taxed (leading to a simplification of the underlying decision strategy), we investigated whether the affect gap is impacted by a time pressure manipulation. Participants were asked to choose between affect‐rich prospects (medical lotteries) and economically equivalent but relatively affect‐poor prospects (monetary lotteries), either without a time constraint or under time pressure. The results indicated that the affect gap manifested similarly under time pressure as without time pressure. Specifically, differences between affect‐rich and affect‐poor choices in strategy selection did not differ between time pressure conditions, and differences in decision quality and risk aversion were even slightly attenuated under time pressure. The findings suggest that the differences in decision behavior between affect‐rich and affect‐poor choices are not driven by cognitive constraints. We discuss the potential psychological mechanisms involved in the affect gap.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Research on intuition often produces conflicting results and suffers from reliability issues due to the lack of tools that can conclusively evaluate a person&#39;s latent intuitive position. It has been recently proposed that a decision maker&#39;s intuitive position can be evaluated by estimating parameters with sequential sampling models (SSMs), which provide a biologically plausible framework to measure how intuition affects decisions. In two studies, we use the drift diffusion model (DDM), as a type of SSM, to investigate topics where intuition is difficult to evaluate. In Study 1, we used the DDM to examine how the cognitive reflection test (CRT) scores relate to intuition in risky decision making and found that individuals with high CRT scores had superior performance and relied more on intuition. These findings challenge the conventional view that high CRT scores imply less reliance on intuition and that intuition is detrimental to decision performance. In Study 2, we examined the cross‐domain stability of the preference for intuition and found that decision makers rely more on intuition in the social decision domain than in the risky decision domain and that these measures are not correlated across the two domains. The evidence for this unstable preference has hitherto primarily resulted from self‐reports, which have a questionable ability to assess the preference for intuition. In both studies, we demonstrate that the DDM can accurately simulate the decision outcome and decision time patterns that are affected by intuition, providing evidence for the usefulness of DDM analysis in the study of intuition.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Biases are prevalent in human judgment and decision‐making (JDM). Previous research has suggested that some biases might share common underlying causes and can be accounted for under dual‐process theories in which fast and error‐prone System 1 drives erroneous behavior. Here, we use an online paradigm to investigate similarities and differences in behavior across three commonly studied cognitive bias phenomena: cognitive reflection test (CRT), gambler&#39;s fallacy (GF), and conjunction fallacy (CF). These are all thought to emerge during biased System 1 processing. Critically, we examine both summative performance metrics and process tracing measures derived from mouse cursor movements and growth curve analysis (GCA). Summative performance in these tasks was broadly in line with previous studies, and we replicated correlations in accuracy between tasks (CRT vs. CF and CRT vs. GF). However, we found key differences in our GCA of mouse trajectories. Specifically, in the CRT and the CF tasks, participants tended to choose the incorrect option more quickly relative to the correct option, as might be expected. However, the opposite tendency was observed for GF—people tended to take longer to choose the wrong answer. We also found evidence from the mouse movement analyses for between‐task differences in the extent to which participants were tempted by the option they did not choose. These findings challenge prominent dual‐process accounts of JDM and highlight the potential of process tracing (and in particular mouse movement analyses) for revealing insights into cognitive processes.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Previous research in the judge–advisor paradigm has focused on how judges utilize the wisdom of others by taking their advice and on the beneficial effect of receiving advice on judges&#39; postadvice final judgments about the exact same problem. However, a completely different possibility of how judges might benefit from advice has been overlooked so far: Learning processes could improve the accuracy of judges&#39; subsequent initial judgments from one problem to another problem on the same type of task as well. Hence, we test the assumption that advice can induce individual performance enhancements that differ as a function of the advisor&#39;s judgment accuracy. The results of three experiments support our hypothesis and indicate positive learning, particularly when participants receive high‐quality advice. Furthermore, we show that external information about the advisor&#39;s accuracy is not crucial for the occurrence of these individual performance enhancements. In general, our results suggest that advice can have a positive effect on judges&#39; subsequent initial judgments.</span>

Framing effects undermine the presumption among many in the law that plea decisions will be rational and made “in the shadow of trial.” This is an important extension of the psychological literature. However, given the complexity of the process of plea bargaining, and in particular, the fact that it is controlled by the prosecutor, involves bargaining with counsel, is done in secret, and there are few restrictions, the practical import of framing effects for reforming plea bargains is doubtful. Nonetheless, given that plea bargaining privileges efficiency over truth, the additional principle of fairness is too often missing from the plea bargain literature. Reyna et al. usefully bring that fundamental concern back into focus.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT This study examines whether monetary priming increases children&#39;s cheating and moderates the effect of prize attractiveness on their cheating behavior. While rational economic theory suggests that individuals cheat more when incentives are greater, previous findings have been inconsistent. We propose that monetary priming could explain these mixed results, hypothesizing that it may not only increase cheating but also influence sensitivity to reward magnitude. We conducted a quasi‐experimental study in which children (7–10 years old, N = 178) were primed (or not) with money (real or symbolic money) before participating in a “roll a die” task that determined the number of rewards they could obtain. This task utilized an electronic die (DICE+), which enabled us to identify both actual and self‐reported values of die rolls. As expected, monetary priming (both real and symbolic) increased cheating among the children. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that while participants were more inclined to cheat for more attractive prizes in non‐monetary priming conditions, they became insensitive to the attractiveness of potential gains after monetary priming. These findings suggest that monetary priming may activate a business decision frame in which rewards of any size can prompt action, and proportionality is not taken into account. Our results may help explain inconsistencies in previous studies on the relationship between incentives and cheating, suggesting that unintentional monetary priming (e.g., through monetary incentives) in some experiments could mask the effects of reward size.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">For standard preferences under uncertainty, minimal requirements are proposed to identify cardinal utility and subjective, potentially nonadditive, beliefs. This is achieved through an application of betting consistency. This preference principle says that outcome midpoints derived from preferences over bets on an event are also midpoints when elicited from bets on a different event. This consistency requirement provides a simplified elicitation tool, while it also serves as a robustness test for utility measurements. An analyst can use betting consistency to identify a client’s cardinal utility index independent of the client’s beliefs. This follows from our simplified foundation for the biseparable utility model, the widely adopted framework for empirical measurements of utility under various sources of uncertainty. As a theoretical tool, betting consistency can be adopted to provide simple and intuitive foundations for new and for existing decision theories. For instance, an event-dependent version of betting consistency, if it is supplemented with Savage’s sure-thing principle or a version of that principle restricted to acts that satisfy Schmeidler’s comonotonicity property, delivers subjective expected utility or Choquet expected utility, as desired. We also demonstrate how models with specific nonadditive beliefs can easily be derived through bespoke formulations of betting consistency.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Do individuals anticipate time inconsistency in others? This paper jointly investigates beliefs about one’s own and others’ present bias. In an online laboratory experiment, participants engaged in a real-effort task display little awareness of their own present bias but anticipate present bias in others. Structurally, I estimate a present bias parameter [Formula: see text] of 0.82. Participants perceive others’ [Formula: see text] to be 0.87, indicating substantial sophistication, contrasted with 1.03 for themselves, indicating full naïveté. At the individual level, asymmetric naïveté correlates with overoptimism regarding one’s own versus others’ task enjoyment and time availability. The wedge in beliefs about present bias can inform equilibrium outcomes in a number of collaborative, competitive, and hierarchical settings, including teams in the workplace, management practices such as deadlines and tournament incentive schemes, and household consumption decisions.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Human–algorithm collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent in the economy and society. However, this collaboration is not always fruitful, and in extreme cases, people become human borgs or totally averse to algorithms. The key to collaborative value is whether humans and algorithms can complement each other in decision making, but it is challenging for humans to disagree with algorithmic recommendations at the right time (i.e., to disagree when algorithms are wrong and not disagree when algorithms are right). To understand the centric role of disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration and examine when and how it benefits, we conducted a field experiment in which human evaluators and algorithms worked together to evaluate loan applications under four scenarios, that is, limited/rich information and with/without disclosure of algorithm rationale. Our results show that human–algorithm collaboration decisions outperformed human- or algorithm-only decisions, and these collaborative values varied across the four scenarios. We further propose a theoretical framework for mechanism examination that centers on the formation and effectiveness of disagreement. We validate the framework empirically and come to the following findings: (1) disagreement exhibits a sizable and nonlinear influence on collaborative value, (2) the differences between human evaluators and algorithms in decision making contribute to disagreement but not to collaborative value, (3) algorithm self-contradiction triggers disagreement and helps human evaluators disagree with algorithms at the right time. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights on how collaborative value is achieved and managerial insights on how to manage disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Weaning patients from mechanical ventilators is a crucial decision in intensive care units (ICUs), significantly affecting patient outcomes and the throughput of ICUs. This study aims to improve the current extubation protocols by incorporating predictive information on patient health conditions. We develop a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision process with predictions of future state to support extubation decisions. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and provide important insights into how predictive information can lead to different decision protocols. We demonstrate that adding predictive information is always beneficial, even if physicians place excessive trust in the predictions, as long as the predictive model is moderately accurate. Using a comprehensive data set from an ICU in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, we evaluate the effectiveness of various policies and demonstrate that incorporating predictive information can reduce ICU length of stay by up to 3.4% and, simultaneously, decrease the extubation failure rate by up to 20.3%, compared with the optimal policy that does not utilize prediction. These benefits are more significant for patients with poor initial conditions upon ICU admission. Both our analytical and numerical findings suggest that predictive information is particularly valuable in identifying patients who could benefit from continued intubation, thereby allowing for personalized and delayed extubation for these patients.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">One of the most important challenges in decision theory has been how to reconcile the normative expectations from Bayesian theory with the apparent fallacies that are common in probabilistic reasoning. Recently, Bayesian models have been driven by the insight that apparent fallacies are due to sampling errors or biases in estimating (Bayesian) probabilities. An alternative way to explain apparent fallacies is by invoking different probability rules, specifically the probability rules from quantum theory. Arguably, quantum cognitive models offer a more unified explanation for a large body of findings, problematic from a baseline classical perspective. This work addresses two major corresponding theoretical challenges: first, a framework is needed which incorporates both Bayesian and quantum influences, recognizing the fact that there is evidence for both in human behavior. Second, there is empirical evidence which goes beyond any current Bayesian and quantum model. We develop a model for probabilistic reasoning, seamlessly integrating both Bayesian and quantum models of reasoning and augmented by a sequential sampling process, which maps subjective probabilistic estimates to observable responses. Our model, called the Quantum Sequential Sampler, is compared to the currently leading Bayesian model, the Bayesian Sampler (J. Zhu et al., 2020) using a new experiment, producing one of the largest data sets in probabilistic reasoning to this day. The Quantum Sequential Sampler embodies several new components, which we argue offer a more theoretically accurate approach to probabilistic reasoning. Moreover, our empirical tests revealed a new, surprising systematic overestimation of probabilities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">The efficient representation of visual information is essential for learning and decision making due to the complexity and uncertainty of the world, as well as inherent constraints on the capacity of cognitive systems. We hypothesize that biological agents learn to efficiently represent visual information in a manner that balances performance across multiple potentially competing objectives. In this article, we examine two such objectives: storing information in a manner that supports accurate recollection (maximizing veridicality) and in a manner that facilitates utility-based decision making (maximizing behavioral utility). That these two objectives may be in conflict is not immediately obvious. Our hypothesis suggests that neither behavior nor representation formation can be fully understood by studying either in isolation, with information processing constraints exerting an overarching influence. Alongside this hypothesis we develop a computational model of representation formation and behavior motivated by recent methods in machine learning and neuroscience. The resulting model explains both the beneficial aspects of human visual learning, such as fast acquisition and high generalization, as well as the biases that result from information constraints. To test this model, we developed two experimental paradigms, in decision making and learning, to evaluate how well the model&#39;s predictions match human behavior. A key feature of the proposed model is that it predicts the occurrence of commonly found biases in human decision making, resulting from the desire to form efficient representations of visual information that are useful for behavioral goals in learning and decision making and optimized under an information processing constraint.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Cognitive scientists and neuroscientists are increasingly deploying computational models to develop testable theories of psychological functions and make quantitative predictions about cognition, brain activity, and behavior. Computational models are used to explain target phenomena such as experimental effects, individual, and/or population differences. They do so by relating these phenomena to the underlying components of the model that map onto distinct cognitive mechanisms. These components make up a &quot;cognitive state space,&quot; where different positions correspond to different cognitive states that produce variation in behavior. We examine the rationale and practice of such model-based inferences and argue that model-based explanations typically miss a key ingredient: They fail to explain why and how agents occupy specific positions in this space. A critical insight is that the agent&#39;s position in the state space is not fixed, but that the behavior they produce is the result of a trajectory . Therefore, we discuss (a) the constraints that limit movement in the state space; (b) the reasons for moving around at all (i.e., agents&#39; objectives); and (c) the information and cognitive mechanisms that guide these movements. We review existing research practices, from experimental design to the model-based analysis of data, and through simulations we demonstrate some of the inferential pitfalls that arise when we ignore these dynamics. By bringing the agent&#39;s perspective into sharp focus, we stand to gain better and more complete explanations of the variation in cognition and behavior over time, between different environmental conditions, and between different populations or individuals.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Cue-Approach Training (CAT) is a paradigm that enhances preferences without external reinforcements, suggesting a potential role for internal learning processes. Here, we developed a novel Bayesian computational model to quantify anticipatory response patterns during the training phase of CAT. This phase includes individual items, and thus, this marker potentially reflects internal learning signals at the item level. Our model, fitted to meta-analysis data from 28 prior CAT experiments, was able to predict individual differences in nonreinforced preference changes using a key computational marker. Crucially, two new experiments manipulated the training procedure to influence the model&#39;s predicted learning marker. As predicted and preregistered, the manipulation successfully induced differential preference changes, supporting a causal role of our model. These findings demonstrate powerful potential of our computational framework for investigating intrinsic learning processes. This framework could be used to predict preference changes and opens new avenues for understanding intrinsic motivation and decision making.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">While trying to complete arduous tasks (e.g., emails, grading), our attention is often mired by the desire to disengage. Opportunity cost theories of mental effort argue that rather than our &quot;sense of effort&quot; being a cognitive limitation, it is an adaptive signal which repels us from unrewarding tasks toward worthwhile alternatives; in short, this signal ensures our cognitive resources are not spent on fruitless pursuits. The current work tests the primary predictions of the opportunity cost theory of effort: That our phenomenology during a cognitively demanding task (sense of effort and boredom), and subsequent on-task behavior (response times and accuracy), are affected by the value of the available alternatives. Over three experiments, manipulating both the extrinsic value (i.e., monetary reward) and intrinsic value of alternative tasks (i.e., how enjoyable the task is), we find no strong evidence in favor of opportunity cost theories. In Experiment 1, we observe no effect of the extrinsic value of an alternative on participants&#39; subjective ratings or behavior during a primary task. In Experiments 2 and 3, while participants&#39; subjective ratings of a primary task (e.g., sense of effort and boredom) may be affected by the intrinsic value of an alternative, we observe no commensurate changes in participants&#39; performance, as measured by accuracy and response times. We explore the consequences of these results for theories of cognitive effort aversion and detail plausible alternative models, such as error aversion.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Human thinking has long been posited to involve two different cognitive processes, also known as intuition and deliberation. While deliberation is effortful and cognitively costly, intuition is effortless. A central issue for reasoning theories is to account for the trigger of deliberation. Compelling theories explain the trigger of deliberative processes by the existence of a metacognitive experience. A feeling of rightness, of error, or of uncertainty would accompany our intuitions and, depending on their strength, triggers the need to use deliberation. Despite the emotional component that can be assumed in these metacognitive phenomena, and a whole literature linking emotion to cognition, these models do not fully embrace the emotional nature of these experiences, both empirically and theoretically. We believe that the psychology of reasoning, and particularly dual‐process theories, would benefit from fully accepting this emotional dimension of reasoning.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Category learning is essential for making sense of the complex world around us. Unlike traditional laboratory settings, real-world learning often allows individuals to self-regulate their learning process, deciding when they have acquired sufficient knowledge to differentiate between categories. This study investigates how category variability-the extent to which exemplars within a category differ-shapes the duration of the learning process in a novel self-regulated task. Participants explored exemplars from two categories, determining for themselves when they had learned enough to categorize accurately. We found that increased variability within the focal category led participants to sample more extensively, suggesting that learners weigh the costs of continued exploration against the uncertainty introduced by environmental demands. Additionally, the variability of the counter-category emerged as a significant factor influencing the search and learning process, underscoring the relational nature of category acquisition. By examining the interplay between variability in both focal and counter-categories, this study provides novel insights into how learners acquire categories and effectively regulate their learning in response to variability.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract The decision-making processes involved in relying on an external source (cognitive offloading) for memory retrieval tasks have been discussed in numerous publications. The nature of original learning strategies could be an important contributing factor to the decision to offload but is unexamined. In this study we used a paired-associate learning task to investigate the influences of mnemonic (associative) and rote learning strategies on the likelihood of opting out, either by offloading or omitting a response. Further, we investigated the ways that certain outcome variables (specifically, the number of opt-out responses and amount of time spent studying) may in fact influence the relationship between learning strategy and decisions to persist in effortful search. We also investigated the degree to which any effects of learning strategy are specific to either offloading or omission decisions. Overall, we found a mnemonic learning effect of decreased frequency of general opt-out decisions relative to the rote group. Further, we found that mnemonic learning led to longer internal search times prior to opt-out responses, suggesting additional, intentional search processes such as trying to retrieve the original mnemonic, to help recover the response word. A partial mediation of the learning strategy effect on omission latency by performance factors suggested the learning strategy effect affects omission latency independently. Finally, relative to the rote learning strategy, the mnemonic strategy led to fewer instances of offloading, and longer decision latencies for omission responses.</span>
