                Fast &amp;amp; slow decisions under risk: Intuition rather than deliberation drives advantageous choices

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.Would you take a gamble with a 10% chance to gain $100 and a 90% chance to lose $10? Even though this gamble has a positive expected value, most people would avoid taking it given the high chance of losing money. Popular “fast-and-slow” dual process theories of risky decision making assume that to take expected value into account and avoid a loss aversion bias, people need to deliberate. In this paper we directly test whether reasoners can also consider expected value benefit intuitively, in the absence of deliberation. To do so, we presented participants with bets and lotteries in which they could choose between a risky expected-value-based choice and a safe loss averse option. We used a two-response paradigm where participants made two choices in every trial: an initial intuitive choice under time-pressure and cognitive load and a final choice without constraints where they could freely deliberate. Results showed that in most trials participants were loss averse, both in the intuitive and deliberate stages. However, when people opted for the expected-value-based choice after deliberating, they had predominantly already arrived at this choice intuitively. Additionally, loss averse participants often showed an intuitive sensitivity to expected value (as reflected in decreased confidence). Overall, these results suggest that deliberation is not the primary route for expected-value-based responding in risky decision making. Risky decisions may be better conceptualized as an interplay between different types of “fast” intuitions rather than between two different types of “fast” and “slow” thinking per se.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsPsychological variability (i.e., “noise”) displays interesting structure which is hidden by the common practice of averaging over trials. Interesting noise structure, termed ‘stylized facts’, is observed in financial markets (i.e., behaviors from many thousands of traders). Here we investigate the parallels between psychological and financial time series. In a series of three experiments (total N = 202), we successively simplified a market-based price prediction task by first removing external information, and then removing any interaction between participants. Finally, we removed any resemblance to an asset market by asking individual participants to simply reproduce temporal intervals. All three experiments reproduced the main stylized facts found in financial markets, and the robustness of the results suggests that a common cognitive-level mechanism can produce them. We identify one potential model based on mental sampling algorithms, showing how this general-purpose model might account for behavior across these very different tasks.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The AuthorsThere is considerable evidence linking cognitive reflection with utilitarian judgments in dilemmas that involve sacrificing someone else for the greater good. However, the evidence is mixed on the question of whether cognitive reflection is associated with utilitarian judgments in self-sacrificial dilemmas. We employed process dissociation to extract a self-sacrificial utilitarian (SU) parameter, an altruism (A) parameter, an other-sacrificial (OU) utilitarian parameter, and a deontology (D) parameter. In Study 1, the cognitive reflection test (CRT) positively correlated with both SU and OU (replicated in Studies 2 and 4, pre-registered). In Study 2, we found that instructing participants to rely on reason increased SU and OU (replicated in Study 4, pre-registered). In Study 3, we found that SU and OU positively correlated with giving in the single-game version of the public goods game (replicated in Study 4, pre-registered), which provides behavioral validation that they are genuine moral tendencies. Together, these studies constitute strong cumulative evidence that SU and OU are both valid measures that are associated with reliance on cognitive reflection.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier B.V.Reported perception of a new stimulus is either attracted toward or repelled away from task-irrelevant prior stimuli. While prevailing theories propose that the opposing serial biases may stem from distinct stages of information processing, the exact role of working memory (WM) in the serial bias remains unclear despite its consistent involvement in nearly all pertinent studies. Additionally, it is not well understood whether this bias is primarily driven by the biased representation itself or by the decision-making process for the new stimulus. In the present study, we used an orientation delayed estimation paradigm with an attention-demanding intervening task, designed to disrupt the maintenance of stimulus information to investigate the role of WM in serial bias. In the analysis, we scrutinized the trajectory of mouse reports and response time to investigate how the response unfolds over time. Our findings indicate that the serial bias went from repulsive to attractive when WM maintenance was interrupted by the intervening task, and that the associated response trajectories and response time exhibited patterns that cannot be explained by the biased representation alone. These results demonstrate that the task-irrelevant prior stimulus influences the decision for the new stimulus, with the direction of the bias being determined by attentional demand during WM maintenance, thereby placing significant constraints on existing theories on the serial bias effect.</span>

Yet, robust mechanisms of distractor suppression are hypothesized to support the control of attention, which presumably serve in the interest of managing distraction. In the present study, I examine whether participants are aware of the cost of distraction with respect to task performance, and whether they are motivated to manage this cost even when it is effortful to do so. Across three experiments, participants were willing to exert physical effort in order to reduce the frequency with which they encountered physically salient distractors, and in a fourth experiment tended to prefer trials with fewer distractors when given a choice over distractor frequency. Importantly, the amount of physical effort exerted varied as a function of the degree to which task-irrelevant distractors impaired search performance, suggesting that people are sensitive to the cost of distraction.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 The Author(s)Understanding the systematic ways that human decision making departs from normative principles has been important in the development of cognitive theory across multiple decision domains. We focus here on whether such seemingly “irrational” decisions occur in ethical decisions that impose difficult tradeoffs between the welfare and interests of different individuals or groups. Across three sets of experiments and in multiple decision scenarios, we provide clear evidence that contextual choice reversals arise in multiples types of ethical choice settings, in just the way that they do in other domains ranging from economic gambles to perceptual judgments (Trueblood et al., 2013; Wedell, 1991). Specifically, we find within-participant evidence for attraction effects in which choices between two options systematically vary as a function of features of a third dominated and unchosen option—a prima facie violation of rational choice axioms that demand consistency. Unlike economic gambles and most domains in which such effects have been studied, many of our ethical scenarios involve features that are not presented numerically, and features for which there is no clear majority-endorsed ranking. We provide empirical evidence and a novel modeling analysis based on individual differences of feature rankings within attributes to show that such individual variations partly explains observed variation in the attraction effects. We conclude by discussing how recent computational analyses of attraction effects may provide a basis for understanding how the observed patterns of choices reflect boundedly rational decision processes.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Previous work has identified characteristic neural signatures of value-based decision-making, including neural dynamics that closely resemble the ramping evidence accumulation process believed to underpin choice. Here we test whether these signatures of the choice process can be temporally dissociated from additional, choice-‘independent’ value signals. Indeed, EEG activity during value-based choice revealed distinct spatiotemporal clusters, with a stimulus-locked cluster reflecting affective reactions to choice sets and a response-locked cluster reflecting choice difficulty. Surprisingly, ‘neither’ of these clusters met the criteria for an evidence accumulation signal. Instead, we found that stimulus-locked activity can ‘mimic’ an evidence accumulation process when aligned to the response. Re-analysing four previous studies, including three perceptual decision-making studies, we show that response-locked signatures of evidence accumulation disappear when stimulus-locked and response-locked activity are modelled jointly. Collectively, our findings show that neural signatures of value can reflect choice-independent processes and look deceptively like evidence accumulation.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Experiments suggest that people fail to take into account interdependencies between their choices—they do not broadly bracket. Researchers often instead assume people narrowly bracket, but existing designs do not test it. We design a novel experiment and revealed preference tests for how someone brackets their choices. In portfolio allocation under risk, social allocation, and induced-value shopping experiments, 40–43 percent of subjects are consistent with narrow bracketing, and 0–16 percent with broad bracketing. Adjusting for each model’s predictive precision, 74 percent of subjects are best described by narrow bracketing, 13 percent by broad bracketing, and 6 percent by intermediate cases.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Causes sometimes decrease rather increase the probability of an effect, as when drinking coffee lowers the probability of sleep or an aspirin eliminates a headache. This research tests how two causal reasoning errors that have influenced the development of theories of human causal reasoning manifest themselves in the presence of inhibitory causal relations. Past research with generative causal relations (a cause makes its effect more probable) has shown that people violate the Markov condition, the pattern of independence that should obtain among causally related variables. And it has shown that they explain away-the phenomenon in which one should lower likelihood of one event when another is discovered to have occurred (e.g., exonerating one murder suspect when evidence against another is found)-too little or not at all. The new empirical findings reported here reveal that both sorts of errors manifest themselves when inhibitory causal relations are present although, unexpectedly, the direction of those errors sometimes reverses. Only the mutation sampler, a rational process model of human causal reasoning, correctly predicted these novel empirical findings. These results support the view that causal reasoning errors can be understood as arising from rational inference constrained by limited cognitive resources.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We present a model-based analysis of aging effects in three symbolic numeracy tasks using three groups of subjects (young adults, 60- to 69-year-olds, and 70- to 90-year-olds). The tasks are number discrimination (is this number greater or less than 50), number memory (was this number in the list of numbers just displayed), and number line (point to where this number is on this number line). The first two tasks were fit by the standard two-choice diffusion model and the last one by the spatially continuous diffusion model (Ratcliff, 2018). Results showed good fits of the models to accuracy (choices) and response time distributions. In the tasks, nondecision time (the time to encode a stimulus and make a response) increased with age, but the amount of evidence needed for a decision (boundary settings) increased in the number discrimination and number memory tasks, but not the number line task. The number discrimination task produced conflicting accuracy and response time results as a function of age, but the model-based analyses resolved these differences. In the number memory task, drift rates (evidence used to drive the decision process) were lower for the older adults than for young adults, but for the other two (easier) tasks, there was no change in drift rate with age. The analyses extracted differences among individuals in model components, some of which were systematic across tasks. In particular, drift rates were correlated across tasks, which shows consistent individual differences across tasks, results that could not have been obtained without model-based analyses.

Previous work on the negative effects of such traps has focused on static learning environments. The current work examines an additional negative effect of learning traps in dynamic environments-blindness to change in the features that predict decision outcomes. In two experiments (N = 416), participants had to decide whether to approach members of two different categories, respectively associated with either gains or losses. Early in learning, a category rule involving two feature dimensions predicted category membership. Subsequently, there was a change in the feature composition of this rule. When outcome feedback was only provided when an item was approached, a substantial proportion of participants fell into the trap of using a simple one-dimensional rule to guide approach decisions. Most of these participants did not notice the subsequent rule change and never learned the new rule. Signaling the possibility of rule change (Experiment 2) had no effect on change blindness for those in the learning trap but did improve learning of the new rule for those who initially avoided the trap.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024 Elsevier Inc.The multiplicative inequality (MI) introduced by Sattath and Tversky (1976) is a rare example of a simple and intuitively appealing condition relating choice probabilities across choice sets of different sizes. It is also a testable implication of two models of stochastic discrete choice: the Elimination by Aspects model of Tversky (1972b) and the independent random utility model. We prove several results on the multiplicative inequality and its relationship to the regularity condition. One major result illustrates how little the MI constrains binary choice probabilities: it implies that every system of binary choice probabilities on a universe of choice objects can be extended to a complete system of choice probabilities satisfying the MI. In this sense, the MI is complementary to axioms for binary choice probabilities, of which many have been proposed. We also discuss choice environments where the multiplicative inequality is implausible.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">One of the key human cognitive capabilities is to extract regularities from the environment to guide behavior. An attentional set for a target feature can be established through statistical learning of probabilistic target associations; however, whether an array of attentional sets of predictive target features can be established during intentional learning, and how they might guide attention, is not known yet. To address these questions, we had human observers perform a visual search task where we instructed them to try to use color to find their target shape. We structured the task with a fine-grained statistical regularity such that the target shapes appeared in different colors with five unique probabilities (i.e., 33%, 26%, 19%, 12%, and 5%) while we recorded their electroencephalogram. Observers rapidly learned these regularities, evidenced by being faster to report targets that appeared in higher probability colors. These effects were not due to unequal sample sizes or simple feature priming. More importantly, equivalent speeding across a set of high-probability colors suggests that the brain was driving attention to multiple targets simultaneously. Our electrophysiological results showed larger amplitude N2 posterior contralateral component, indexing perceptual attention, and late positive complex (LPC) component, indexing postperceptual processes, for targets paired with high-probability colors. These electrophysiological data suggest that the learned attentional sets change both perceptual selection and how postperceptual decisions are made. In sum, we show that multiple attentional sets can be established during intentional learning that accompanies general task acquisition and that these attentional sets can simultaneously guide attention by enhancing both perceptual attention and postperceptual processes.
