                  <span style="color:#374151;">Characterizing behavior in sequential problems is often complicated by the presence of multiple decision rules with overlapping predictions. To address this issue, we introduce a new experimental and econometric approach for identifying decision strategies in sequential contexts. This approach consists of eliciting conditional strategies (as opposed to direct choices) and measuring policy adherence via maximum-likelihood estimation (as opposed to counting coincidences). Applying this approach to several common types of sequential problems increases the proportion of uniquely identifiable subjects by up to a third relative to standard methods and yields the following findings. First, in search and stopping problems, decision makers respond less strongly to state and time of the dynamic problem than in problems that do not have a stopping structure. Second, decision rules are often biased toward being more accepting (less demanding) than the optimal policy would predict. Third, the format used to elicit decisions (menu-based choice versus numeric threshold entry) has a significant effect on policy adoption. In addition to identifying decision rules that better fit observed behavior in dynamic choice problems, these results have implications for firms serving customers who face sequential decisions. We use a revenue management example (optimal subscription service pricing) to show that failing to account for the relevant decision rules can reduce firm profits by up to 54%.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We introduce formal measures for two psychological factors of probabilistic risk attitudes: attractiveness (motivational factor) and discriminability (cognitive factor). Unlike previous approaches that relied on heuristic proxies, our measures precisely capture these two fundamental factors. Our measures are mathematically tractable, robust to discontinuities, such as in the NEO-additive case, and flexible to be applied to any weighting function, as well as to both small and large probabilities. Additionally, through detailed numerical analysis, we examine to what extent existing weighting function parameters capture the two factors: attractiveness and discriminability. Finally, using these new measures, we provide a formal understanding of the independence between motivational and cognitive factors.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We experimentally study dynamic resource allocation decisions using product development as the context. A product manager must accept or reject a series of design improvement opportunities, given a limited budget. Human subjects perform well when the cost-to-implement is fixed throughout the project. However, in a more complex setting where the cost increases for the latter half of the project, subjects’ performance worsens substantially. We use the strategy frequency estimation method to analyze subjects’ decision mechanisms and find that many subjects are (a) mis-weighting future periods (underweighting in the simple case, overweighting in the complex) and (b) focusing on only the highest value opportunities. These heuristics perform poorly in the complex setting, leading to excess savings and are a counterproductive reaction to the cost increase. Top performers in the complex setting do well by decomposing the problem into two subproblems resembling the simpler setting, which they can handle nearly optimally. In a second study, we test managerial interventions based on prompting this decomposition approach to improve performance in the complex setting. Merely prompting subjects to consider problem decomposition is largely ineffective. However, additionally sharing a “best practice” budget plan that gives information about how and why top performers decompose the problem significantly improves performance. Our results highlight when decision makers will perform well or poorly in a dynamic resource allocation problem and show effective ways to reframe the problem and improve their performance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Consumers’ privacy choice between withholding and sharing personal data may change during crises. Crises not only alter personal considerations of benefits and costs of this choice, but also trigger societal considerations, such as use of shared data in crisis management. Although the literature on privacy choice has focused on personal considerations, research on how this choice is influenced by broader circumstances remains sparse. We address this topic by leveraging newly available location big data and a global public health crisis as a natural shock. Analyzing 22 billion raw records of intertemporal individual-level mobile location data across a wide spectrum of cities in the United States, we present the first large-scale evidence that opt-out reduces during a crisis, and societal, beyond personal, considerations might have influenced consumers’ privacy choices.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In player-versus-player video games, players’ natural desire to win and avoid losing has created an opportunity for game developers to sell “pay-to-win” add-ons, digital items that give buyers a competitive advantage against other players. In this paper, we investigate the pricing and design of a pay-to-win add-on, its effect on the base game, and profit implications for the developer. When a large share of the players are less price sensitive and highly willing to buy the pay-to-win add-on, we find that, surprisingly, the developer may prefer not to introduce it. Further, when it is optimal to sell the add-on, the developer designs it to be less (more) powerful in games where players are highly (moderately) sensitive to losing. In practice, the developer may design rewards or penalties in the game to influence players’ sensitivities to winning and losing, respectively. Our findings suggest that when selling a pay-to-win add-on, the developer ideally prefers players’ loss sensitivity to be neither too high nor too low, whereas high win sensitivity tends to benefit the developer. The introduction of a pay-to-win add-on influences the optimal pricing and design of the base game. In particular, the developer decreases the base game price and may even sell it as a freemium. Despite the price reduction, investment in game quality may actually increase. From the players’ perspective, our analysis shows that the introduction of a pay-to-win add-on can actually improve player surplus. In an extension of our core model, we show that the developer may prefer to customize player-to-player matching probabilities based on ownership of the pay-to-win add-on, making players who own it more likely to be matched against nonowners. However, such customization is not always optimal, and under some market conditions, the developer may optimally abstain from customizing matching probabilities. In another extension, we show that the developer may benefit from setting a negative price for the base game; counterintuitively, player surplus does not increase from negative pricing.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Statistical discrimination relies on people inferring unobservable characteristics of group members based on their beliefs about the group. Across four preregistered experiments (N = 9,002), we show that accurate information about the composition of top performers can induce incorrect beliefs about performance differences across groups when the groups are of unequal size. Because people fail to account for base rates, they underestimate the performance of individuals from smaller groups. As a result, when participants in our experiments receive true information about the gender composition of top performers in a male-dominated candidate pool, they are less likely to hire women, even when there are no gender differences in performance (Study 1). Similarly, they are less likely to hire better-performing non-White candidates when the racial demographics of the candidate pool reflect the U.S. population (Study 4). We show that these choices reflect an error in statistical reasoning, rather than being motivated by a desire to discriminate against any particular group (Study 2). Despite leading to less accurate beliefs, participants disproportionately seek out information about top performers when given the choice, and discrimination thus persists when information selection is endogenous (Study 3).

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We present two findings on how environmental policy uncertainty impacts municipal bond returns. First, yields increase after a new pollution standard is proposed but decrease after this standard is finalized. Second, after annual announcements of compliance status, yields fall for counties that remain in compliance but increase for newly noncompliant counties. We present suggestive evidence linking these short-run municipal bond market reactions to long-run changes in pollution and housing prices. Our findings suggest that increases in either regulatory stringency or uncertainty over future environmental policy increase the cost of municipal debt raised to fund schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Information platforms have emerged in the developing world to improve price transparency and welfare for smallholder suppliers. Meanwhile, sustaining welfare improvement often requires such platforms to benefit both suppliers and buyers. This paper studies the impact of price transparency on market price and welfare in smallholder supply chains, and identifies conditions and driving forces for creating benefits to both suppliers and buyers. Motivated by granular data from smallholder supply chains, we develop a new Hotelling model of price search, where price-setting buyers face the operational challenges of demand asymmetry and costly underage or overage amid uncertain supply. We find that high overage costs, combined with high demand asymmetry that dominates random supply variations, give rise to two-sided benefits, driven by price competition benefiting the suppliers and demand signaling benefiting the buyers under increased transparency. Moreover, achieving two-sided benefit requires implementing a well-chosen level of price transparency, and, in some cases, creating a low uncertainty environment for buyers. These results help close the gap between the empirical literature and the theoretical economic literature on this topic, and offer possible explanations for the variation in empirical findings. We provide managerial recommendations for information platform designers, including for our partnering platform, on identifying the target markets and whether to implement full or partial transparency.
