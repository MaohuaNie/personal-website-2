                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Daniel Kahneman, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, developed foundational frameworks for understanding human decision-making. Building on that tradition, this article proposes that individuals’ ex ante assessments of the likelihood of good and bad outcomes serve as reference points that shape the ex post utility of lottery outcomes. In prospect theory, prior holdings act as reference points for evaluating outcomes—but probabilities themselves play no such role. This article introduces Managed Expectations Theory , which rests on two core hypotheses: Reference Point Hypothesis : Ex ante probabilities serve as reference points for ex post utility. Specifically, more pessimistic expectations about uncertain outcomes enhance ex post utility, regardless of whether the outcome turns out to be good or bad. Four experiments, using a nationally representative adult sample of over 1,000 participants, strongly support this hypothesis. Lower [higher] ex ante likelihoods are associated with greater ex post utility for good [bad] outcomes. Created Likelihoods Hypothesis : Recognizing that likelihood assessments act as reference points, individuals deliberately manage these assessments to be more pessimistic than an objective or statistical “outside view”—in order to boost their ex post utilities. Supporting this conjecture, the good outcomes participants labeled as “likely” occurred far more often than the bad outcomes they labeled as “likely.” These created likelihoods help explain a central feature of prospect theory’s probability weighting function: the underestimation of high-probability good events and the overestimation of low-probability bad events.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Cognitive biases are patterned decisions that deviate from the predictions of rational-choice models. They often have profound and adverse impacts on behavior, making them important to understand. The common approach to them catalogs empirical regularities that exist but lacks a sound theoretical foundation to explain and predict why the biases exist, why they are patterned as they are, and how we can best predict new and deeper patterns. The approach described here can provide such a foundation, link cognitive biases together (as a function of common underlying psychological processes), and increase our predictive power. This article reviews a 20-year arc of research that tested whether looking at cognitive biases through the lens of evolutionary biology—essentially, at how all brains are shaped to have behavioral leanings—can illuminate the origins of biases and thereby enable useful, testable predictions. The test case centers on the “endowment effect” and led to four interconnected discoveries about how, when, and where the endowment effect arises. It culminated in the successful prediction of a very large percentage of the variance in endowment effect magnitudes across a large new set of items—something never before accomplished. The key fact is that natural selection can bias decision-making toward choices that were rational in ancestral conditions but are mismatched to modern environments, yielding outcomes that are irrational yet predictably patterned. More broadly, the success of this test case suggests that many other cognitive biases may be similarly approached and potentially linked by this predictively useful framework.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Although the importance of the second-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion is well established, the importance of higher-order risk attitudes has only recently begun to be recognized. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to directly measure higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion in an expected utility framework using choices between compound lotteries and show how it can be easily implemented in behavioral studies. Specifically, we provide a theoretical basis for using risk apportionment to reveal the intensity of higher-order risk attitudes, and then draw upon our theoretical results to develop a simple, systematic, and generalizable procedure for eliciting higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients. We demonstrate our approach in a laboratory experiment and find that the modal second-order, third-order, and fourth-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients are positive and small. Further, we find that degrees of risk aversion are positively correlated across orders. Additionally, we discuss alternative implementations of our procedure.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We isolate the causal effect of changing the riskiness of choices on the gender gap in real world outcomes. We do so by exploiting a national reform to the regrade system of Norwegian universities that generated exogenous variation in the probabilities of the outcome of regrade requests. Using unique individual-level administrative data, we show that both the expected value of a regrade request, as well as the downside risk, increased substantially as a result of the policy. We then show how the ostensibly gender-neutral policy substantially increased gaps between men and women because they differed in their risk preferences and beliefs. Specifically, the exogenous change in the riskiness of requesting a regrade augmented the gender gap in regrade requests by 90%. We demonstrate that this has important implications for students through its impact on their grades. We disentangle the relative importance of mechanisms through auxiliary reduced-form analyses, structural estimation, and a supplemental laboratory experiment. Taken together, our mechanism analyses suggest that gender differences in risk preferences and loss aversion are not sufficient to explain the increased gender gap after the policy change, and that gender differences in confidence or beliefs are necessary to rationalize the data and more broadly consistent with the patterns we observe.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study the classic divide-and-choose method for equitably allocating divisible goods between two players who are rational, self-interested Bayesian agents. The players have additive values for the goods. The prior distributions of those values are common knowledge. We consider both the cases of independent values and values that are correlated across players (as occurs when there is a common-value component). We describe the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose game and identify several cases where it is possible to efficiently compute equilibria. An approximation algorithm is presented for the case when the distribution over the chooser’s value for each good follows a normal distribution, along with a randomized approximation algorithm for the case of uniform distributions over intervals. A mixture of analytic results and computational simulations illuminates several striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus unknown preferences. Most notably, given unknown preferences, the divider has a compelling “diversification” incentive in creating the chooser’s two options. This incentive leads to multiple goods being divided at equilibrium, quite contrary to the divider’s optimal strategy when preferences are known. In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in judging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of the divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players’ levels of knowledge about each other’s values, the correlations between the players’ values, and the number of goods being divided. Under fairly mild assumptions, we show that the chooser is strictly better off for a small number of goods, whereas the divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In portfolio optimization, the computational complexity of implementing almost stochastic dominance has limited its practical applications. In this study, we introduce an optimization framework aimed at identifying the optimal portfolio that outperforms a specified benchmark under almost second-degree stochastic dominance (ASSD). Our approach involves discretizing the return range and establishing both sufficient and necessary conditions for ASSD. We then propose a three-step iterative procedure: first, identifying a candidate portfolio; second, assessing its optimality; and third, refining the discretization scheme. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the portfolio identified through this iterative process improves with each iteration, ultimately converging to the optimal solution. Our empirical study, utilizing industry portfolios, demonstrates the efficacy of our approach by consistently identifying an optimal portfolio within a few iterations. Furthermore, comparative analysis against other decision criteria, such as mean-variance, second-degree stochastic dominance, and third-degree stochastic dominance, reveals that ASSD generally leads to portfolios with higher out-of-sample average excess returns but also entails increased variations and risks.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Organizational learning often involves groups that learn from feedback on their decisions over time (also known as “learning by doing” or “learning from experience”). Although organizational learning is frequently assumed to resemble individual learning from experience, there is limited evidence to validate this assumption. Furthermore, groups in organizations often have centralized rather than decentralized decision making, but we know little about how they differ in learning from experience. Using a combination of experimental data and computational modeling, we compare individuals to groups that are either decentralized or centralized in their decision making. We find that centralized groups behave like hyper-individuals: They update and explore more than individuals (who, in turn, update and explore more than decentralized groups). Our evidence shows that not only do groups differ from individuals because of aggregation processes but also that individuals change their behaviors simply by virtue of being in a group (a context effect). Specifically, we find that participants assigned as leaders in centralized groups become proactive learners who seek novel information to learn by deviating from experience. Implications are drawn for how this might alter the way we conceptualize and model organizational learning. This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organization.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We introduce the click-based MNL choice model, a framework for capturing customer purchasing decisions in e-commerce settings. Specifically, we augment the classical Multinomial Logit choice model by assuming that customers only consider the items they have clicked on before they proceed to compare their random utilities. In this context, we study the resulting assortment optimization problem, where the objective is to select a subset of products, made available for purchase, to maximize the expected revenue. Our main algorithmic contribution comes in the form of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem, showing that the optimal expected revenue can be efficiently approached within any degree of accuracy. To establish this result, we develop several technical ideas, including enumeration schemes and stochastic inequalities, which may be of broader interest. Using data from Alibaba’s online marketplace, we fit click-based MNL and latent class MNL models to historical sales and click data in a setting where the online platform recommends a personalized six-product display to each user. We propose an estimation methodology for the click-based MNL model that leverages clickstream data and machine learning classification algorithms. Our numerical results suggest that clickstream data are valuable for predicting choices and that the click-based MNL model can outperform standard logit-based models in certain settings.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">The obesity rate has grown to epidemic proportions in the United States. Recent scientific studies suggest that excess intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is one of the primary contributors to weight gain. One option to address the growing obesity epidemic is to discourage SSB consumption through fiscal policies such as imposing a soda excise tax. In this paper, we apply the Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction to present evidence that consumers are rationally addicted to the consumption of soda drinks that contain caffeine and/or sugar. Motivated by the evidence, we build a dynamic structural model to quantify the impact of soda taxes on soda purchases and consumption and study the role of addiction in influencing this impact. We extend the canonical rational addiction model by introducing a multidimensional framework of addiction, which allows for the decomposition of addiction in the context of soda consumption into two distinct components: caffeine and sugar. Using the parameter estimates, we conduct counterfactual analyses based on realistic policy scenarios and evaluate how different tax policies would affect soda purchases. For example, one policy experiment indicates that a tax of one cent per ounce only on sugary soda categories would lead to a 50.2% decrease in sugary soda consumption. In addition, we find that sugar seems to play a bigger role in influencing substitution patterns than caffeine. We further investigate how these taxes affect welfare through a change in addiction level and emphasize the importance of addiction by comparing estimation results with and without addiction in the model. To understand the externalities associated with soda taxation, we integrate our counterfactual results with causal estimates from recent medical literature. Our findings suggest that individuals could decrease their medical costs by $642 to $717 per year under various tax schemes. These results underscore the potential of soda taxes to significantly improve public health and reduce obesity-related healthcare costs. This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In this paper, we use a novel natural experiment and Norwegian tax data to quantify the causal impact of unemployment risk on individual savings. By comparing individuals who live in the same area but face different increases in risk, we show that a one-percentage-point increase in unemployment rates increases safe assets by 1.3%. Reassuringly, this effect is driven by low-tenured workers, who face the highest increase in risk. Savings in risky financial assets remain unaffected, implying a decrease in the overall risky share of individual portfolios. We use two independent approaches, relying either on cross-sectional variation or time series variation, to quantify the importance of job loss risk in accounting for higher savings during recessions. Our results suggest that unemployment risk can explain 60%–80% of the recession-induced increase in safe assets. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ‘utilitarian’ cost–benefit reasoning (CBR). Here we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people’s reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N = 2,328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. The participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: participants adjusted their decisions according to which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modelling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract In many real‐world settings, people often have to make judgments with incomplete information. Estimating unknown quantities without using precise quantitative modeling and data is called guesstimation, which is often needed in forecasting settings. Furthermore, research in education found that solving guesstimation problems builds general problem‐solving skills. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation on how people solve guesstimation problems. We study their problem‐solving behavior with think‐aloud methods, and we identify solution strategies that are frequently used. In a two‐response paradigm, we first ask for gut‐feeling answers to guesstimation questions and then allow deliberation before a second answer is given. Comparing the quality of these two answers reveals that deliberation improves the answer quality significantly. In a second experiment, we additionally elicit participants&#39; confidence about their deliberated answers by asking for an entire distribution instead of just a point estimate. We find that participants are generally overconfident in their answers. We discuss guesstimation tasks as suitable test‐beds for studying human deliberative judgments in general and in the more specific context of improving forecasting through appropriate artificial intelligence tools.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Personal possession wields a potent influence on decision-making, such that objects owned-by-self are categorized more speedily than comparable items belonging to other people. The temporal characteristics of this self-prioritization effect, however, are little understood. Notably, it is uncertain whether the duration of self-bias is sensitive to the characteristics of owned objects, particularly when the items have implications for the self-concept. Accordingly, using an object-classification task, here we explored the extent to which a theoretically important stimulus-related factor—reward value—influences the time course of self-bias. Across three experiments, participants classified high- and low-value items (i.e., stones [Exp. 1], cryptocurrencies [Exp. 2 &amp;amp; 3]) that allegedly belonged to self and a friend. A consistent pattern of effects was observed, indicating that reward value moderated both the extent and persistence of self-prioritization. Specifically, although self-prioritization emerged for both high- and low-value items, this facilitatory effect was larger and more enduring for the former (vs. latter) stimuli. These findings highlight the dynamic character of decisional bias, with implications for theoretical accounts of self-function.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Many psychological theories assume that observable responses are determined by multiple latent processes. Multinomial processing tree (MPT) models are a class of cognitive models for discrete responses that allow researchers to disentangle and measure such processes. Before applying MPT models to specific psychological theories, it is necessary to tailor a model to specific experimental designs. In this tutorial, we explain how to develop, fit, and test MPT models using the classical pair-clustering model as a running example. The first part covers the required data structures, model equations, identifiability, model validation, maximum-likelihood estimation, hypothesis tests, and power analyses using the software multiTree. The second part introduces hierarchical MPT modeling which allows researchers to account for individual differences and to estimate the correlations of latent processes among each other and with additional covariates using the TreeBUGS package in R.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper develops a framework to extend the strategic form analysis of cursed equilibrium (CE) developed by Eyster and Rabin (2005) to multistage games. The approach uses behavioral strategies rather than normal form mixed strategies and imposes sequential rationality. We define and characterize properties of cursed sequential equilibrium (CSE) and apply it to four canonical economic applications: signaling games, reputation building, durable goods monopoly, and the dirty faces game. These applications illustrate various implications of CSE, show how and why it differs from sequential equilibrium and CE, and provide evidence from laboratory experiments that support the empirical relevance of CSE.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Common values auction models, where bidder decisions depend on noisy signals of common values, provide predictions about Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) outcomes. In settings where these common values can be estimated, these predictions can be tested. We propose a series of tests, robust to assumptions about the signal structure, to determine whether the observed data could have been generated by a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In the setting of oil and gas lease auctions in New Mexico, we find evidence that participation decisions are correlated and that participants systematically underbid in light of ex post outcomes.

                Does “item-specific” cognitive control operate at the item level?

              <p style='margin:0 0 12px;font-size:14px;color:#374151;line-height:1.6;'>The paper tests whether item-level cognitive control occurs in a picture-word Stroop task by manipulating item- and category-level congruencies across experiments; results suggest control largely operates at the category level rather than the item level, with response-time data used to infer the underlying cognitive mechanisms.</p>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">People learn and retrieve cognitive control settings (e.g., attentional focus) associated with stimulus and contextual features. It has been theorized that control adjustments occur at the item level (e.g., for a specific picture) and the category level (i.e., for the overarching category represented by the picture), but evidence is lacking for the former. We aimed to determine whether control can truly operate at the item level. In Experiments 1-3, we manipulated item-specific proportion congruencies in a picture-word Stroop task while holding category-specific proportion congruencies constant at 50% congruent. One item in each animal category (e.g., Dog 1, Fish 1) was mostly congruent (MC) and one item (e.g., Dog 2, Fish 2) was mostly incongruent (MI). Item-level control (i.e., larger Stroop effect for MC items compared to MI items) was observed in Experiment 1, but neither Experiment 2 nor 3 replicated this finding. Experiments 4a and 4b used MC and MI categories, with each comprising both MC and MI items, allowing us to potentially index both levels of control. However, the findings indicated that control operated only at the category level and not the item level. Using novel stimuli, Experiment 5 showed Stroop effects differed between items that shared a response but were visually/conceptually dissimilar. This finding suggests that applying item-level control may be difficult when items within a category are visually/conceptually similar (as in Experiments 1-4). Collectively, our findings provided little evidence for item-level control; instead, the findings suggest control primarily operates at the category level in the picture-word Stroop task.
