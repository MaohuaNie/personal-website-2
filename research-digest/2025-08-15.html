                  <span style="color:#374151;">Sequences of choice response times exhibit ubiquitous and strong multiscale dynamics (i.e., sequential dependencies across a broad range of temporal scales). Despite their pervasive nature, multiscale dynamics are poorly understood. We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision-maker&#39;s ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence accumulation process with subsecond range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus history, error-related, and hard-easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multiscale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Daniel Kahneman, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, developed foundational frameworks for understanding human decision-making. Building on that tradition, this article proposes that individuals’ ex ante assessments of the likelihood of good and bad outcomes serve as reference points that shape the ex post utility of lottery outcomes. In prospect theory, prior holdings act as reference points for evaluating outcomes—but probabilities themselves play no such role. This article introduces Managed Expectations Theory , which rests on two core hypotheses: Reference Point Hypothesis : Ex ante probabilities serve as reference points for ex post utility. Specifically, more pessimistic expectations about uncertain outcomes enhance ex post utility, regardless of whether the outcome turns out to be good or bad. Four experiments, using a nationally representative adult sample of over 1,000 participants, strongly support this hypothesis. Lower [higher] ex ante likelihoods are associated with greater ex post utility for good [bad] outcomes. Created Likelihoods Hypothesis : Recognizing that likelihood assessments act as reference points, individuals deliberately manage these assessments to be more pessimistic than an objective or statistical “outside view”—in order to boost their ex post utilities. Supporting this conjecture, the good outcomes participants labeled as “likely” occurred far more often than the bad outcomes they labeled as “likely.” These created likelihoods help explain a central feature of prospect theory’s probability weighting function: the underestimation of high-probability good events and the overestimation of low-probability bad events.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Cognitive biases are patterned decisions that deviate from the predictions of rational-choice models. They often have profound and adverse impacts on behavior, making them important to understand. The common approach to them catalogs empirical regularities that exist but lacks a sound theoretical foundation to explain and predict why the biases exist, why they are patterned as they are, and how we can best predict new and deeper patterns. The approach described here can provide such a foundation, link cognitive biases together (as a function of common underlying psychological processes), and increase our predictive power. This article reviews a 20-year arc of research that tested whether looking at cognitive biases through the lens of evolutionary biology—essentially, at how all brains are shaped to have behavioral leanings—can illuminate the origins of biases and thereby enable useful, testable predictions. The test case centers on the “endowment effect” and led to four interconnected discoveries about how, when, and where the endowment effect arises. It culminated in the successful prediction of a very large percentage of the variance in endowment effect magnitudes across a large new set of items—something never before accomplished. The key fact is that natural selection can bias decision-making toward choices that were rational in ancestral conditions but are mismatched to modern environments, yielding outcomes that are irrational yet predictably patterned. More broadly, the success of this test case suggests that many other cognitive biases may be similarly approached and potentially linked by this predictively useful framework.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Although the importance of the second-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion is well established, the importance of higher-order risk attitudes has only recently begun to be recognized. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to directly measure higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion in an expected utility framework using choices between compound lotteries and show how it can be easily implemented in behavioral studies. Specifically, we provide a theoretical basis for using risk apportionment to reveal the intensity of higher-order risk attitudes, and then draw upon our theoretical results to develop a simple, systematic, and generalizable procedure for eliciting higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients. We demonstrate our approach in a laboratory experiment and find that the modal second-order, third-order, and fourth-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients are positive and small. Further, we find that degrees of risk aversion are positively correlated across orders. Additionally, we discuss alternative implementations of our procedure.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We isolate the causal effect of changing the riskiness of choices on the gender gap in real world outcomes. We do so by exploiting a national reform to the regrade system of Norwegian universities that generated exogenous variation in the probabilities of the outcome of regrade requests. Using unique individual-level administrative data, we show that both the expected value of a regrade request, as well as the downside risk, increased substantially as a result of the policy. We then show how the ostensibly gender-neutral policy substantially increased gaps between men and women because they differed in their risk preferences and beliefs. Specifically, the exogenous change in the riskiness of requesting a regrade augmented the gender gap in regrade requests by 90%. We demonstrate that this has important implications for students through its impact on their grades. We disentangle the relative importance of mechanisms through auxiliary reduced-form analyses, structural estimation, and a supplemental laboratory experiment. Taken together, our mechanism analyses suggest that gender differences in risk preferences and loss aversion are not sufficient to explain the increased gender gap after the policy change, and that gender differences in confidence or beliefs are necessary to rationalize the data and more broadly consistent with the patterns we observe.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Organizational learning often involves groups that learn from feedback on their decisions over time (also known as “learning by doing” or “learning from experience”). Although organizational learning is frequently assumed to resemble individual learning from experience, there is limited evidence to validate this assumption. Furthermore, groups in organizations often have centralized rather than decentralized decision making, but we know little about how they differ in learning from experience. Using a combination of experimental data and computational modeling, we compare individuals to groups that are either decentralized or centralized in their decision making. We find that centralized groups behave like hyper-individuals: They update and explore more than individuals (who, in turn, update and explore more than decentralized groups). Our evidence shows that not only do groups differ from individuals because of aggregation processes but also that individuals change their behaviors simply by virtue of being in a group (a context effect). Specifically, we find that participants assigned as leaders in centralized groups become proactive learners who seek novel information to learn by deviating from experience. Implications are drawn for how this might alter the way we conceptualize and model organizational learning. This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organization.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We introduce the click-based MNL choice model, a framework for capturing customer purchasing decisions in e-commerce settings. Specifically, we augment the classical Multinomial Logit choice model by assuming that customers only consider the items they have clicked on before they proceed to compare their random utilities. In this context, we study the resulting assortment optimization problem, where the objective is to select a subset of products, made available for purchase, to maximize the expected revenue. Our main algorithmic contribution comes in the form of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem, showing that the optimal expected revenue can be efficiently approached within any degree of accuracy. To establish this result, we develop several technical ideas, including enumeration schemes and stochastic inequalities, which may be of broader interest. Using data from Alibaba’s online marketplace, we fit click-based MNL and latent class MNL models to historical sales and click data in a setting where the online platform recommends a personalized six-product display to each user. We propose an estimation methodology for the click-based MNL model that leverages clickstream data and machine learning classification algorithms. Our numerical results suggest that clickstream data are valuable for predicting choices and that the click-based MNL model can outperform standard logit-based models in certain settings.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsClassical random utility models imply a consistency property called regularity. Decision makers who satisfy regularity are at least as likely to choose an option x from a set X of available options as from any larger set Y that contains X. In light of ample empirical evidence for context-dependent choice that violates regularity, some researchers have questioned the descriptive validity of all random utility models. In this article, we show that not all random utility models imply regularity. We propose a general framework for random utility models that accommodate context dependence and may violate regularity. Mathematically, like the classical models, context-dependent random utility models form convex polytopes. They yield behavioral predictions for those choice sets from which choices are made, by specifying combinations of preference rankings across two or more contexts. We discuss how context-dependent models can be less or more parsimonious than the classical models. Random utility models with or without regularity can be tested with contemporary methods of order-constrained inference.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The Author(s)We present a novel interpretation of delay discounting – a theoretical mechanism by which decision-makers discount the current value of reward if it is obtained at a future time rather than immediately. The theory proposes that decision-makers rationally account for the natural phenomenon of compounded interests (use exponential discounting) but need to take an average or expected value over some uncertainty distribution for the compound interest rate. Hence, the name Expected Exponential Discounting (EED) theory of inter-temporal choice. We show that EED provides a mechanism that unifies multiple empirically discovered descriptive discounting functions and fits to key qualitative findings about delay discounting in humans under non-sequential contexts, such as for hypothetical questions about delayed rewards. The general, falsifiable and comparatively minimal EED theory provides a good sanity check for more complex accounts of delay discounting, but also supports the derivation of new empirical predictions and reference points.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsThe classic (to date unsolved) stochastic binary choice problem asks under what conditions a given stochastic choice function defined on pairs of alternatives derives from a random ranking. We propose a solution to the problem for the case in which at most two rankings are assigned positive probability. This case is psychologically motivated and interesting for applications. It is structurally different from the general case in that the choice functions that are derived from a random ranking do not necessarily form a convex polytope, hence they are not even in principle described by a set of linear inequalities.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsThis paper contributes to the theoretical literature on decision models where agents may encounter challenges in comparing alternatives. We introduce a characterization of countable Richter–Peleg multi-utility representations, both semicontinuous (upper and lower) and continuous, within preorders that may not be total. The proposed theorems provide a comprehensive mathematical framework, complementing previous results of Alcantud et al. and Bosi on countable multi-utility representations. Our characterizations establish necessary and sufficient conditions through topological properties and constructive methods via indicator functions. Furthermore, we introduce a topological framework aligned with the property of strong local non-satiation and provide a novel theorem containing sufficient conditions for the existence of countable upper semi-continuous multi-utility representations of a preorder. The results demonstrate that preference representations can be achieved using countably many functions rather than uncountable families, with implications for computational tractability and the identification of maximal elements in optimization contexts.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 Elsevier Inc.A typical redundant signals experiment assesses response time (RT) performance when either of two (or more) presented signals is sufficient to make a correct response against response time to respond to either of the signals alone. In some studies perception of both signals takes place faster than either alone and even faster than what a parallel system with independent, unlimited capacity channels can predict. This behavior is referred to as super capacity (Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995). In fact, J. Miller&#39;s earlier 1982 data was interpreted as exhibiting performance that was so super capacity that it violated an upper bound on performance through a statistic known in mathematics as the Poisson Inequality, and now referred to in the literature as the race model inequality (RMI). The most popular type of explanatory model assumes that information (treated as an activation random variable in each channel) from two parallel channels is summed into a subsequent single channel where the sum is compared with a criterion activation. Such a process is dubbed coactivation and several specific such models were shown to be able to make such predictions. Then, it was shown by Townsend &amp; Nozawa (1995) that any arbitrary counter model (i.e., with arbitrary stochastic processes for the concurrent counters) perforce predicted violation of the RMI. Further, using the systems factorial technology statistical function named the survivor interaction contrast (SIC), they proved that standard Poisson counter models predict a specific distinctive function for coactive processing. However, other architectures (e.g., parallel and serial models) are entirely general rather than being confined to Poisson counters. Subsequently, Houpt &amp; Townsend (2011) generalized the SIC prediction to the popular Ratcliff–Wiener drift–diffusion process. Our satisfied goal here was to further extend the classes of covered coactive systems to the popular Linear Ballistic Accumulator (e.g., Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008), the entire class of Inhomogeneous Poisson Processes, and a novel system we call the bare bones stochastic process. In addition, we adduce a set of sufficient conditions that any monotone distribution should meet to predict for their convolution to obey the canonical SIC form.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ‘utilitarian’ cost–benefit reasoning (CBR). Here we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people’s reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N = 2,328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. The participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: participants adjusted their decisions according to which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modelling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 Elsevier B.V.Choices necessitate opportunity costs: choosing one option means foregoing another. Despite their critical role in decision making, people often neglect opportunity costs and are less likely to make purchases when reminded of them. Here, we seek to understand whether and how opportunity-cost neglect can be explained by attention, a relationship that has been proposed but not explicitly tested. Participants made eye-tracked, incentivized purchase decisions in two conditions: one with implicit opportunity costs (e.g., “Buy” vs. “Do Not Buy”) and one with explicit opportunity costs (e.g., “Buy” vs. “Keep Money”). Across two studies (approximately 30,000 choices), we find lower purchase rates when opportunity costs are explicit. More importantly, we show that the relationship between attention and opportunity cost considerations is two-fold. First, the amount of attention to the outside option is greater when opportunity costs are explicit, which partly accounts for the effect of opportunity cost salience on choice. Second, for some framings, the predictive power of attention to opportunity costs is greater when opportunity costs are explicit. Using the attentional drift-diffusion model, we model the effect of opportunity cost salience on choice via attention. These findings help explain why people are more likely to purchase when explicit opportunity cost reminders are absent.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2024In collaborative decision-making contexts, people typically share their metacognitive experience of confidence to convey the degree of certainty in their decisions. To reach collective decisions, collaborators&#39; individual beliefs can be aggregated and weighted according to their respective confidence, thereby enhancing group accuracy beyond individual capabilities. Previous joint decision-making studies have shown that individuals tend to adopt the same scale for communicating their levels of confidence. However, confidence judgments vary not only in terms of metacognitive bias, that is whether individuals tend to report generally low or high confidence, but also in terms of metacognitive accuracy, or how well the confidence judgments align with choice accuracy. In the first two experiments, where the metacognitive accuracy of the collaborator was manipulated and explicitly communicated to participants, individuals increased their average confidence levels as the metacognitive accuracy of the collaborator decreased, while their own metacognitive accuracy remained unaffected. Trial-wise analyses showed that participants differentially adapted their confidence after a collaborator made a wrong group decision, depending on the metacognitive accuracy of the collaborator. In two follow up studies, we showed that both manipulations (i.e. manipulating objective differences in the metacognitive accuracies of the collaborators and explicitly communicating these differences) were necessary for these effects to emerge. Our findings shed light on how collaborative decision-making contexts can dynamically affect metacognitive processes.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsOur perception is shaped by prior expectations, including those about the timing of our sensations. These temporal expectations can be formed by recognizing patterns in the onset of sensory inputs. However, in the somatosensory domain, it remains unclear how these expectations impact the speed and accuracy of somatosensory judgments, as previous research has yielded mixed results. Here, participants used auditory tones to anticipate the onset of forces applied to their fingers and discriminated their intensity compared to a reference force. Experiment 1 showed that participants had worse discrimination sensitivity and higher thresholds for expected versus unexpected forces. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these costs to include perceptual accuracy, even when comparing expected to expectation-free forces, and further revealed reaction time benefits. Drift-diffusion modelling suggested that expectations speeded non-decisional processes while simultaneously slowing somatosensory evidence accumulation. These findings demonstrate both costs and benefits of temporal expectations in somatosensory perception and decision-making.</span>

Published by Elsevier B.VOptimal foraging requires agents to strike a balance between potential costs and rewards of interacting with stimuli in the environment. Research on human and animal foraging shows that the value an agent assigns to a stimulus is correlated with the speed of their reaching movement towards that stimulus (Shadmehr et al., 2019). Humans and other animals learn about the value of stimuli in their environment by observing others acting (Pyke, 1984; Boyd, Richerson &amp; Henrich, 2011). Considering that humans are able to derive specific mental states such as intentions, emotions or confidence from specific movement parameters (Becchio et al., 2012), we aimed to investigate whether observers can use an actor&#39;s movement speed to: 1) infer the value of a foraging stimulus; and 2) use such cues to inform their own foraging behavior. The current study first replicated the effect of stimulus value on reaching movements in a novel foraging task (Exp. 1, N = 34). In three further experiments, we demonstrate that, depending on the speed by which an actor reaches for stimuli, observers infer the value of these stimuli (Exp. 2, N = 54), express foraging preferences (Exp. 3, N = 54), and invest time and effort to forage (Exp. 4, N = 105). This demonstrates that observers optimize their own explore-exploit decisions by inferring the value of a stimulus from the manner by which an actor approaches it, highlighting the fundamental role that action understanding plays in successful foraging.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract In many real‐world settings, people often have to make judgments with incomplete information. Estimating unknown quantities without using precise quantitative modeling and data is called guesstimation, which is often needed in forecasting settings. Furthermore, research in education found that solving guesstimation problems builds general problem‐solving skills. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation on how people solve guesstimation problems. We study their problem‐solving behavior with think‐aloud methods, and we identify solution strategies that are frequently used. In a two‐response paradigm, we first ask for gut‐feeling answers to guesstimation questions and then allow deliberation before a second answer is given. Comparing the quality of these two answers reveals that deliberation improves the answer quality significantly. In a second experiment, we additionally elicit participants&#39; confidence about their deliberated answers by asking for an entire distribution instead of just a point estimate. We find that participants are generally overconfident in their answers. We discuss guesstimation tasks as suitable test‐beds for studying human deliberative judgments in general and in the more specific context of improving forecasting through appropriate artificial intelligence tools.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract A large part of how people learn about their shared world is via social information. However, in complex modern information ecosystems, it can be challenging to identify deception or filter out misinformation. This challenge is exacerbated by the existence of a dual‐learning problem whereby: (1) people draw inferences about the world, given new social information; and simultaneously (2), they draw inferences about how credible various sources of information are, given social cues and previous knowledge. In this context, we investigate how social influence and individual cognitive processing interact to explain how one might lose the ability to reliably assess information. Crucially, we show how this happens even when individuals engage in rational belief updating and have access to objective cues of deception. Using an agent‐based model, the Reputation Game Simulation, we show that mere misinformation is not the problem: The dual‐learning problem can be solved successfully with limited Bayesian reasoning, even in the presence of deceit. However, when certain agents consistently engage in fully deceptive behavior, intentionally distorting information to serve nonepistemic goals, this can lead nearby agents to unlearn or discount objective cues of credibility. This is an emergent delusion‐like state, wherein false beliefs resist correction by true incoming information. Further, we show how such delusion‐like states can be rehabilitated when agents who had previously lost the ability to discern cues of credibility are put into new, healthy—though not necessarily honest—environments. Altogether, this suggests that correcting misinformation is not the optimal solution to epistemically toxic environments. Though difficult, socially induced cognitive biases can be repaired in healthy environments, ones where cues of credibility can be relearned in the absence of nonepistemic communication motives.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract With the rise of wearable technologies, mobile devices and artificial intelligence comes a growing pressure to understand downstream effects of cognitive offloading on children&#39;s future thinking and behavior. Here, we explored whether compelling children to use an indiscriminate cognitive offloading strategy affects their subsequent strategy selection. Six‐ to 9‐year‐olds ( N = 128) completed a task where manual rotation of stimuli sometimes offloaded mental rotation demand and other times did not. In phase 1, some children were compelled to use manual rotation indiscriminately, whereas others could only use mental rotation. In phase 2, where children could freely choose their strategy, older children who were compelled to use manual rotation in phase 1 were significantly more selective in their strategy use, rotating the stimuli relatively more frequently when this behavior would offload cognitive demand than when it would not. These results provide preliminary evidence that pre‐exposure to indiscriminate cognitive offloading can promote selectivity in children&#39;s subsequent strategy use, though this selectivity may reflect a desire to avoid cognitive effort rather than improve task performance.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Personal possession wields a potent influence on decision-making, such that objects owned-by-self are categorized more speedily than comparable items belonging to other people. The temporal characteristics of this self-prioritization effect, however, are little understood. Notably, it is uncertain whether the duration of self-bias is sensitive to the characteristics of owned objects, particularly when the items have implications for the self-concept. Accordingly, using an object-classification task, here we explored the extent to which a theoretically important stimulus-related factor—reward value—influences the time course of self-bias. Across three experiments, participants classified high- and low-value items (i.e., stones [Exp. 1], cryptocurrencies [Exp. 2 &amp;amp; 3]) that allegedly belonged to self and a friend. A consistent pattern of effects was observed, indicating that reward value moderated both the extent and persistence of self-prioritization. Specifically, although self-prioritization emerged for both high- and low-value items, this facilitatory effect was larger and more enduring for the former (vs. latter) stimuli. These findings highlight the dynamic character of decisional bias, with implications for theoretical accounts of self-function.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Research shows strong impacts of congruency on memory for social information, but whether memory advantages emerge for congruent or incongruent information is inconsistent. Social targets can have congruency between their facial expression (e.g., smiling, frowning) and behaviors (e.g., helping, hurting). The current study investigated the impact of congruency between valence of facial expressions and behaviors on memory and approach/avoidance (AA) decisions. At encoding (i.e., impression formation), participants formed positive or negative impressions of social targets. Social targets were represented by a picture with a positive or negative facial expression and a congruent or incongruent positive or negative behavior. At retrieval, we measured memory for multiple details (impressions, behaviors, facial expression) associated with targets encountered during encoding (impression formation). In a final approach/avoidance phase of the experiment, participants then judged whether they would approach or avoid social targets based on what they remembered about targets. Results showed that impression memory and behavior memory affected subsequent AA decisions, with correct memory for positive and negative impressions leading to approach and avoidance decisions, respectively. However, there was no impact of expression memory on AA decisions, suggesting participants did not base their decisions on irrelevant expression information. Further, results showed no effect of congruency on impression memory, behavior memory, or AA decisions, and limited impact on expression memory. Overall, findings may cast doubt on congruency/incongruency effects found in prior memory-related work, possibly suggesting an impact of the task.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract People frequently rely on subjective assessments of importance to navigate daily decisions, yet the psychological underpinnings of these judgments are not fully understood. Crucially, non-diagnostic factors, such as memory accessibility, may skew these evaluations. The present study examined the interplay between memory outcomes and judgments of importance. Participants engaged in a memory test involving 20 scientific theories, followed by assessments of each theory’s importance. Results revealed a bias whereby successfully recalled theories were deemed more important than those not recalled. Additionally, even in the case of retrieval failure, metacognitive feelings of knowing positively correlated with importance judgments. Finally, when memory was tested via recognition, which lowers retrieval difficulty, this importance bias was diminished, indicating that the effort or challenge of retrieval may be used as a cue for importance. Across these experiments, a consistent pattern emerged (recalled information was considered more important than forgotten information) that aligns with the hypothesis that memory accessibility and subjective judgments of importance are intertwined. Thus, people may deem things they remember as having higher importance and things they forget as having less importance, based in part on the degree of memory accessibility which is not necessarily a valid indicator of the true status of that information’s value.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The Author(s)Understanding the determinants of healthy and unhealthy food choices is paramount to improving public health. This paper zooms in on the role of evaluation mode (i.e., separate versus joint evaluation) in consumers’ food choices. A series of four studies in the paper and four studies in the online appendix (N = 2024) investigate the effect of evaluation mode on the choice share of healthy and unhealthy foods. In line with earlier work in various domains, the results demonstrate that joint evaluation of healthy and unhealthy food options improves consumers’ decision-making by decreasing (increasing) the choice share of unhealthy (healthy) food, compared to the separate evaluation mode. We show that this relies on the simple fact that the healthiness attribute is difficult to judge in isolation, certainly in comparison with the taste attribute. Indeed, when healthiness becomes easier to evaluate, unhealthy choices become more frequent in the joint evaluation mode as well. The studies are set up to allow us to distinguish the evaluability account from the justification and the goal-highlighting accounts. The theoretical contributions, the methodological implications for the self-control literature, and the managerial implications are discussed.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Many psychological theories assume that observable responses are determined by multiple latent processes. Multinomial processing tree (MPT) models are a class of cognitive models for discrete responses that allow researchers to disentangle and measure such processes. Before applying MPT models to specific psychological theories, it is necessary to tailor a model to specific experimental designs. In this tutorial, we explain how to develop, fit, and test MPT models using the classical pair-clustering model as a running example. The first part covers the required data structures, model equations, identifiability, model validation, maximum-likelihood estimation, hypothesis tests, and power analyses using the software multiTree. The second part introduces hierarchical MPT modeling which allows researchers to account for individual differences and to estimate the correlations of latent processes among each other and with additional covariates using the TreeBUGS package in R. All examples including data and annotated analysis scripts are provided at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/24pbm/). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">In recent years, discussions comparing high-threshold and continuous accounts of recognition-memory judgments have increasingly turned their attention toward critical testing. One of the defining features of this approach is its requirement for the relationship between theoretical assumptions and predictions to be laid out in a transparent and precise way. One of the (fortunate) consequences of this requirement is that it encourages researchers to debate the merits of the different assumptions at play. The present work addresses a recent attempt to overturn the dismissal of high-threshold models by getting rid of a background selective-influence assumption. However, it can be shown that the contrast process proposed to explain this violation undermines a more general assumption that we dubbed &quot;single-item generalization.&quot; We argue that the case for the dismissal of these assumptions and the claimed support for the proposed high-threshold contrast account does not stand the scrutiny of their theoretical properties and empirical implications.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Conflict tasks often yield smaller mean congruency effects when relevant (target) and irrelevant (distractor) information is mostly incongruent rather than mostly congruent. While this proportion congruency effect may reflect proactive control adaptation, only a few previous studies have provided convincing evidence for proactive control adaptation when ruling out contingency learning and reactive (item-specific) control adaptation. In this study, we present further evidence for proactive control adaptation (as reflected in proportion congruency effects and asymmetrical list-shifting effects in contingency-controlled diagnostic items) across three experiments (each N = 100 participants) using manual counting Stroop tasks (Experiment 1: number words as distractors; Experiment 2: Arabic numerals as distractors; Experiment 3: number words and Arabic numerals as inducer and diagnostic items or vice versa). To better understand the processes underlying proactive control adaptation, we conducted fine-grained distributional analyses (delta functions) and model-based analyses (diffusion model for conflict tasks). These analyses suggest that proactive control adaptation in manual counting Stroop tasks mainly reflects adjustments in the strength of distractor suppression rather than in the timing of distractor suppression, the strength of target amplification, or response caution. Additional distributional and diffusion model reanalyses of the data by Spinelli and Lupker (2023, Experiments 1-3) revealed a similar pattern in vocal color Stroop tasks. In conclusion, the present study provides new evidence for proactive control adaptation in manual counting Stroop tasks and indicates that proactive control adaptation mainly reflects adjustments in the strength of distractor suppression in both manual and vocal Stroop tasks.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper develops a framework to extend the strategic form analysis of cursed equilibrium (CE) developed by Eyster and Rabin (2005) to multistage games. The approach uses behavioral strategies rather than normal form mixed strategies and imposes sequential rationality. We define and characterize properties of cursed sequential equilibrium (CSE) and apply it to four canonical economic applications: signaling games, reputation building, durable goods monopoly, and the dirty faces game. These applications illustrate various implications of CSE, show how and why it differs from sequential equilibrium and CE, and provide evidence from laboratory experiments that support the empirical relevance of CSE.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This study documents the potential influence of attention probes in experimental paradigms by addressing their unintended effects on response time measurements. Attention probes, which are commonly used to assess participant engagement, may introduce task-switch costs that can confound experimental results. We show how probe-induced biases inflated findings related to reinforcement from sensorimotor predictability and generate a fictitious behavioral response to sensory prediction error. We show that by excluding task trials immediately after attention probes, these biases can be corrected. We validate this approach in two new experiments devoid of probes. The results confirm that response reinforcement from predictable action effects only accumulates as long as predictions hold. These findings challenge traditional (reward-based) reinforcement models by suggesting a distinct mechanism for reinforcement from sensorimotor predictability. The validated corrective method provides a practical tool for mitigating similar confounds in past and future studies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>
