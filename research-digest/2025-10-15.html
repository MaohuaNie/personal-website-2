                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Many social scientists have assumed that people’s preferences can be described by stable and coherent “utility” functions. This notion of stable utility functions has been challenged by cognitive psychologists who suggest that preferences are malleable and constructed in the moment, but neither camp has explained how the subjective valuations underpinning preferences arise. One influential attempt to do so is the Decision by Sampling (DbS) model, which suggests that a quantitative attribute’s (e.g., money sum’s) subjective value is its rank order in a momentarily activated memory sample. DbS thus implies that manipulating the recently experienced attribute distribution should change people’s subsequent valuations of that attribute: for example, from the typically assumed concave shape of the utility function to a convex shape. However, recent studies have pointed out methodological concerns in the evidence previously thought to support this prediction (and thus, DbS). In this preregistered study, we replicate the previous paradigm but address the methodological concerns to test if such a “rank-order” manipulation does change valuations. We derive qualitative predictions from DbS to verify that our conditions yield distinct predictions. We find strong evidence against the DbS’s prediction that a “rank-order” manipulation changes what options the participants select and how strongly they prefer the options. We also find extreme evidence in favor of a contextualization effect, implying that people value formally identical gambles differently depending on whether they cue a real-life setting or not. Although we encourage replication by independent laboratories, these results suggest that the DbS is falsified for this binary choice task.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper introduces source theory, a new theory for decision under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). It shows how Savage’s subjective probabilities, with source-dependent nonlinear weighting functions, can model Ellsberg’s ambiguity. It can do so in Savage’s framework of state-contingent assets, permits nonexpected utility for risk, and avoids multistage complications. It is tractable, shows ambiguity attitudes through simple graphs, is empirically realistic, and can be used prescriptively. We provide a new tool to analyze weighting functions: pmatchers. They give Arrow–Pratt-like transformations but operate “within” rather than “outside” functions. We further show that ambiguity perception and inverse S probability weighting, seemingly unrelated concepts, are two sides of the same “insensitivity” coin.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">A positive relation between the conditional mean and conditional volatility of aggregate stock returns, although viewed as a fundamental law of finance, has been challenging to find empirically. We consider a representative agent asset pricing model with Knightian uncertainty and demonstrate that this risk-return trade-off depends on the agent’s ambiguity attitude (reflecting the agent’s degree of optimism or pessimism). The model predicts that the conditional equity premium is increasing in market volatility, but its slope flattens as market optimism rises. We develop a methodology to extract the representative agent’s ambiguity attitude from our asset pricing model. Results validate our model predictions. We document the significant in-sample and out-of-sample explanatory power of ambiguity attitude in explaining the risk-return trade-off. In our sample, market volatility is not significant in forecasting returns. However, including the market ambiguity attitude leads to a significant positive relationship between volatility and future returns. Hence, our model and results identify market ambiguity attitude as a missing state variable that can explain why the literature has found it difficult to empirically validate the risk-return trade-off.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">People are often unaware that their personal data can serve as valuable inputs for economic activities in secondary data markets. However, whether secondary monetization of personal data determines privacy preferences remains unclear. I examine whether privacy decisions are motivated by the data recipient’s ability to benefit from trading individuals’ data with a third party. A large online laboratory experiment involving personally identifiable psychometric data is implemented with real data-sharing consequences and monetary benefits. I find that individuals decrease their willingness to share data—both in terms of their likelihood of participating in the data market and the prices demanded for such participation—when the recipient’s ability to monetize the data through secondary trade is salient. Strategic responses to updated beliefs about the recipient’s gain from the trade are ruled out via the chosen price elicitation. I find that increased data exposure (to more recipients) does not explain the significant revealed disutility from secondary monetization. These findings are also robust to controlling for the risk exposure differences between data recipients and third parties. This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study the effect of on-the-job experience on base-rate neglect, which is a common bias in assessing conditional probabilities. We do so by carrying out experiments with medical professionals, who are routinely exposed to conditional-probability problems in the form of diagnostic tests, and nonmedical professionals, who are not. As such, medical workers with more years of experience will have had more exposure to base-rate type problems than nonmedical workers with similar years of experience. We estimate the effect of on-the-job experience by comparing the answers of more or less experienced professionals in both the medical and nonmedical domains. Although the incidence of the bias is high for both groups and all levels of experience, we find that more experienced medical workers (a) have lower rates of perfect base-rate neglect (i.e., completely ignoring the base rates), (b) provide more accurate posterior estimates, and (c) adjust their estimates more in response to changes in the base rates. We observe no such difference for nonmedical workers. We conduct a number of robustness checks and consider possible mechanisms, such as education, job or survey attrition, selectivity into medical professions, and experience with false positives. Our results suggests that on-the-job experience mitigates, but does not eliminate, base-rate neglect. This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study short-term and medium-term changes in bank risk-taking as a result of supervision and the associated real effects. For identification, we exploit the European Central Bank’s asset-quality-review (AQR) in conjunction with security and credit registers. After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks reduce riskier securities and credit supply, with the greatest effect on riskiest securities. We find negative spillovers on asset prices and firm-level credit availability. Moreover, nonbanks with higher exposure to reviewed banks acquire the shed risk. After the AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities but not riskier credit, resulting in negative medium-term firm-level real effects. These effects are especially strong for firms with high ex ante credit risk. Among these nonsafe firms, even those with high ex ante productivity, experience negative real effects. Our findings suggest that banks’ liquid assets help them to mask risk from supervisors and risk adjustments banks make in response to supervision have persistent corporate real effects.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Despite the popularity of the phrase “wisdom of the crowd,” not all crowds are wise because not everyone in them acts in an informed, rational manner. Identifying informative actions, therefore, can help to isolate the truly wise part of a crowd. Motivated by this idea, we evaluate the informational value of investors’ bids using data from online, debt-based crowdfunding, in which we were able to track both investment decisions and ultimate repayment statuses for individual loans. We propose several easily scalable variables derived from the heterogeneity of investors’ bids in terms of size and timing. We first show that loans funded with larger bids relative to the typical bid amount in the market or to the bidder’s historical baseline, particularly early in the bidding period, are less likely to default. More importantly, we perform theory-driven feature engineering and find that these variables improve the predictive performance of state-of-the-art models that have been proposed in this context. Even during the fundraising process, these variables improve predictions of both funding likelihood and loan quality. We discuss the implications of these variables, including loan pricing in secondary markets, crowd wisdom in different market mechanisms, and financial inclusion. Crowdfunding platforms can easily implement these variables to improve market efficiency without compromising investor privacy. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.

In our initial public offering experiment, various assets share identical financial risk-return profiles but differ in the intensity and timing of societal benefits, represented by charitable donations. We find that subjects value societal benefits positively and prefer a positive correlation between financial returns and these societal benefits. We offer implications for the design of corporate social responsibility policies and for the pricing of responsible assets. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT It is increasingly recognized that new information is filtered through the lens of prior experience. Research has shown descriptive probability information (“description”) often does not impact decisions for people who have previously observed a sample of outcomes related to the choice (“experience”). However, the effect of description on mental representations of risk probability in the presence of experience has rarely been examined. In two experiments, participants ( n = 263 college students and n = 1032 MTurk workers) played a game that exposed them to a predetermined rate of wins and losses, after which some participants received information about the game&#39;s expected rate of losses. Description strongly impacted participants&#39; verbatim estimates of the risk of losing the game. However, description had little or no detectable impact on participants&#39; gist risk estimates. Further analysis showed that lower gist risk estimates were associated with later decisions to continue playing the game. Verbatim risk estimates were correlated with later decisions, but no effect was observed while controlling for the effects of gist on decisions. This research additionally tested two approaches to strengthening the effect of description on gist, finding a small effect of one approach but not the other. Results suggest that descriptive information materials delivered after experience may be less likely to alter future decisions if the information does not alter gist representations of risk.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT People usually use either alternative‐based or attribute‐based decision strategies to make intertemporal choices. While it is appealing to infer such decision strategies from information search patterns, whether the latter can always reflect the former remains unclear. This research examined the potential correspondence between information search patterns and decision strategies in intertemporal choices under three decision conditions. Two of the conditions involved explicit instructions on whether an alternative‐based or an attribute‐based strategy should be implemented, whereas under the third, free condition, participants were asked to choose solely according to their true preferences. For each condition, alternative‐ and attribute‐based information search patterns were identified based on the numbers of alternative‐based and attribute‐based transitions in eye movements. For the free condition, decision strategies were inferred by comparing the fitting performance of relevant dynamic models. A clear correspondence was found between information search patterns and decision strategies under the instructed conditions, but this correspondence was apparently lacking in the free condition. These results call into question the general practice of inferring decision strategies from process tracing data. Potential reasons for the revealed dissociation and further research to improve understanding of the correspondence between information search patterns and decision strategies are discussed.</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Novices are faster to verify categories at intermediate (&quot;basic&quot;) levels of abstraction (bird) than superordinate (animal) or subordinate (blue jay) levels, whereas experts are equally fast at subordinate and intermediate levels. One explanation (&quot;entry-level hypothesis&quot;) is that for novices, categorization at intermediate levels is faster because it is the &quot;entry level&quot; into conceptual knowledge; experts become as fast at the subordinate level because the subordinate level becomes an alternative entry level. An alternative explanation (&quot;differentiation hypothesis&quot;) is that for novices, categorization at intermediate levels is faster because that level is more differentiated and informative, not that it happens first; experts become as fast at the subordinate level because representations of objects at that level become more differentiated. We evaluated these hypotheses by fitting the diffusion decision model to accuracy and response time data from online participants with various psychometrically measured levels of birding expertise. We identified the alternative hypotheses with diffusion decision model parameters: Differences in nondecision time across category levels are arguably associated with the entry-level hypothesis, whereas differences in drift rate are arguably associated with the differentiation hypothesis. We fitted the diffusion decision model using a Bayesian hierarchical framework to estimate individual differences in model parameters across conditions. Behaviorally, we replicated the entry-level shift online. Theoretically, we found that differences in categorization speed across levels of expertise were captured by differences in both drift rate and nondecision time across levels. These results provide insights into the changes in representations and processes with the development of perceptual expertise. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Human planning tends to be efficient, focusing on a relatively small number of options when considering future paths. Recent proposals have suggested that this efficiency reflects intelligent deployment of the limited resources available for planning. A prediction of this and related proposals is that when individuals spend time thinking should depend on the benefits and costs of additional computation. We tested this hypothesis by measuring how much time humans spent thinking before acting in over 12 million online chess games. Players spent more time thinking in board positions where additional computation was more beneficial. This relationship was greater in stronger players, and was strengthened by considering only the information available to the player at the time of choice. A simple model based on measuring the actual cost of spending time thinking in online chess was able to capture qualitative features of this relationship. These results provide evidence that the amount of time humans spend thinking is appropriately sensitive to the value of computation.</span>

                The impact of language on decision-making: Auction winners are less cursed in a foreign language
              </h3>

              <p style='margin:0 0 12px;font-size:14px;color:#374151;line-height:1.6;'>In plain terms, the study reports that bidding in a foreign language reduces the emotional sting of winning or losing, thereby altering risk-related valuation in auctions. This demonstrates a language-driven modulation of decision processes relevant to economic psychology.</p>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Software is one of the most important assets that needs to be priced in the digital economy. It has emerged as a disruptive technology, with companies primarily valued for their software offerings growing from 2 percent to 13 percent of market share between 1996 and 2023. We document persistent anomalies in growth forecasts and stock returns for software companies, indicating significant deviations from rational expectations over multiple decades. Our findings are consistent with Bayesian investors gradually learning about software’s growing importance, highlighting how markets can be very slow to discern fundamental shifts from transient shocks in noisy data.
