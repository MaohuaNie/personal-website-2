                  <span style="color:#374151;">Understanding how people assign subjective value to outcomes with multiple attributes, such as risk and delay, is central to understanding the structure and manifestation of economic preferences. However, multiattribute preference has been primarily studied through binary choices. The price at which a person would buy, sell, or equate each prospect offers another measure of subjective value that may diverge from multiattribute choice. In both risky and intertemporal domains, choice and price preferences exhibit systematic preference reversals, where a smaller, sooner, or safer option is chosen while a larger, later, or riskier alternative is assigned a higher price. The present study takes a deep dive into how subjective value is assigned in each case in an attempt to reconcile these diverging measurements and methods of assessing value. To explain how and why preferences change across choice and price, the domains of gains and losses, price frames of buying and selling, and varying levels of time pressure, we develop a two-step neural network-based modeling approach. First, we tested cognitive mechanisms underlying value-based judgments and decisions using a switchboard model comparison. Next, we fit and evaluated individualized joint models, where all data from an individual are modeled using parameters and mechanisms that are specific to their best fitting model structure. While mechanisms like delay discounting and risk aversion are common to both models, our results suggest that anchoring and payoff sensitivity diverged between pricing and choice. Extensive differences across elicitation procedures indicate that a common representation of value may remain elusive. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) is the tendency for fast decisions to come at the expense of accurate performance. Evidence accumulation models such as the drift diffusion model can reproduce a variety of behavioral data related to the SAT, and their parameters have been linked to neural activities in the brain. However, our understanding of how biological neural networks realize the associated cognitive operations remains incomplete, limiting our ability to unify neurological and computational accounts of the SAT. We address this gap by developing and analyzing a biologically plausible spiking neural network that extends the drift diffusion approach. We apply our model to both perceptual and nonperceptual tasks, investigate several contextual manipulations, and validate model performance using neural and behavioral data. Behaviorally, we find that our model (a) reproduces individual response time distributions; (b) generalizes across experimental contexts, including the number of choice alternatives, speed- or accuracy-emphasis, and task difficulty; and (c) predicts accuracy data, despite being fit only to response time data. Neurally, we show that our model (a) recreates observed patterns of spiking neural activity and (b) captures age-related deficits that are consistent with the behavioral data. More broadly, our model exhibits the SAT across a variety of tasks and contexts and explains how individual differences in speed and accuracy arise from synaptic weights within a spiking neural network. Our work showcases a method for translating mathematical models into functional neural networks and demonstrates that simulating such networks permits analyses and predictions that are outside the scope of purely mathematical models.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Two leading models of numerosity judgments describe numerical representations as Gaussian distributions on a mental number line. The linear model posits that both the mean and standard deviation of the distributions increase linearly with number, while the logarithmic model assumes logarithmic increases in the mean with constant variability. In this study, we use the selective sampling account, which proposes that information is gathered selectively based on goals and available resources, to explore the cognitive processes underlying variations in variability and scaling. In intermingled displays of blue and yellow dots (blue/yellow task), participants relied on incomplete representations of dots positioned near the center, where spatial resolution is highest, leading to increasing variability with set size. In contrast, spatially separated displays (left/right task) facilitated more comprehensive sampling, resulting in approximately constant variability across set sizes. Behavioral patterns and modeling analyses suggest that the type of scale used is also shaped by the display format, with a more sensitive linear scale applied to compute numerical differences in intermingled displays, and a less sensitive logarithmic scale used to estimate magnitudes for each side in spatially separated displays. Eye-tracking data provide further support for our account, emphasizing the role of selective attention in forming numerical representations and providing a unified framework for understanding variability and scaling across tasks.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Everyday situations require us to face a trade-off to inform our decisions: exploit known information or explore for new information. Although both have risks, empirical research has not shown whether individuals prefer exploring or exploiting across contexts. In the present study, we examined the explore-exploit trade-off as a theoretical framework across two broad domains: decision making and spatial navigation. In this registered report, we applied computational modeling to human behavior on a novel version of the Iowa gambling task to predict behavior on a spatial navigation task in which the navigator must either exploit a learned, familiar route or explore a new shortcut. If the hypothesis that risk tolerance is a domain-general trait is correct, we predicted that explore-exploit patterns would correlate across these tasks. We also examine the predictive power of computational models for the Iowa gambling task on behavioral uncertainty and the role of confidence in spatial navigation strategy. Our findings suggest that, while there is some overlap in risk tolerance between spatial navigation and gambling, the influence of exploration and exploitation on navigational decision making is weaker than initially predicted.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Novices are faster to verify categories at intermediate (&quot;basic&quot;) levels of abstraction ( bird ) than superordinate ( animal ) or subordinate ( blue jay ) levels, whereas experts are equally fast at subordinate and intermediate levels. One explanation (&quot;entry-level hypothesis&quot;) is that for novices, categorization at intermediate levels is faster because it is the &quot;entry level&quot; into conceptual knowledge; experts become as fast at the subordinate level because the subordinate level becomes an alternative entry level. An alternative explanation (&quot;differentiation hypothesis&quot;) is that for novices, categorization at intermediate levels is faster because that level is more differentiated and informative, not that it happens first; experts become as fast at the subordinate level because representations of objects at that level become more differentiated. We evaluated these hypotheses by fitting the diffusion decision model to accuracy and response time data from online participants with various psychometrically measured levels of birding expertise. We identified the alternative hypotheses with diffusion decision model parameters: Differences in nondecision time across category levels are arguably associated with the entry-level hypothesis, whereas differences in drift rate are arguably associated with the differentiation hypothesis. We fitted the diffusion decision model using a Bayesian hierarchical framework to estimate individual differences in model parameters across conditions. Behaviorally, we replicated the entry-level shift online. Theoretically, we found that differences in categorization speed across levels of expertise were captured by differences in both drift rate and nondecision time across levels. These results provide insights into the changes in representations and processes with the development of perceptual expertise. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">How do people recognize objects they have encountered previously? Cognitive models of recognition memory aim to explain overt behavior using latent psychological processes, such as true recognition and pure guessing. Validation studies assess whether the mechanisms underlying cognitive models properly reflect the psychological processes they aim to explain. The present study provides such a validation study for models describing paired-word recognition-a paradigm in which participants have to categorize randomly constructed word pairs. Specifically, introducing a strength manipulation (Experiment 1), presenting certain words more often during study, a base-rate manipulation of response categories (Experiment 2), presenting certain pair types more often during test, a base-rate manipulation of overall frequencies of old and new words (Experiment 3), and a payoff manipulation, differentially incentivizing correct responses (Experiment 4), we assessed the validity of general recognition theory, a multidimensional signal detection theory model, and the paired two-high threshold model, a discrete-state model. Both models captured the strength manipulation as expected on mnemonic parameters describing memory sensitivity and detection probability. Unexpectedly, the base-rate and payoff manipulations affected (strategic) memory retrieval within the discrete-state model (Experiments 2-4) and both strategic retrieval (Experiment 2) and decision boundaries (Experiments 3 and 4) within the continuous model. Implications for model validity and the future use of these models for paired-word recognition are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Metacognition is the ability to monitor and control one&#39;s own cognitive processes, with higher order mechanisms assessing the performance of lower level cognitive operations to determine subjective confidence. An open question is whether metacognitive capacity is domain-general, akin to a conductor overseeing various sections of an orchestra, or whether it is inherently coupled with each domain, resembling a collection of specialized musical directors for each instrument group. Previous studies attempting to address this question have suffered from methodological drawbacks, such as a lack of control over cognitive performance and low statistical power. In this confirmatory, preregistered study, we addressed this gap by testing metacognitive ability in visual perceptual, episodic memory, and semantic memory domains using a newly developed adaptive &quot;trivia&quot; task spanning judgments about nutrition and global economics. We found substantive correlations in metacognitive bias and efficiency across domains, even when controlling for cognitive ability, suggesting up to 15%-20% shared variance in metacognition across different modalities. Surprisingly, however, we found the lowest correlation in metacognition between the two semantic memory domains, despite these tasks being matched on performance and surface-level features. Our results broadly support the existence of a metacognitive &quot;g-factor,&quot; excluding several important methodological confounds, while also highlighting the importance of further research into interindividual differences in metacognitive priors which may explain the lower correlations between the different semantic memory domains.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Many social scientists have assumed that people’s preferences can be described by stable and coherent “utility” functions. This notion of stable utility functions has been challenged by cognitive psychologists who suggest that preferences are malleable and constructed in the moment, but neither camp has explained how the subjective valuations underpinning preferences arise. One influential attempt to do so is the Decision by Sampling (DbS) model, which suggests that a quantitative attribute’s (e.g., money sum’s) subjective value is its rank order in a momentarily activated memory sample. DbS thus implies that manipulating the recently experienced attribute distribution should change people’s subsequent valuations of that attribute: for example, from the typically assumed concave shape of the utility function to a convex shape. However, recent studies have pointed out methodological concerns in the evidence previously thought to support this prediction (and thus, DbS). In this preregistered study, we replicate the previous paradigm but address the methodological concerns to test if such a “rank-order” manipulation does change valuations. We derive qualitative predictions from DbS to verify that our conditions yield distinct predictions. We find strong evidence against the DbS’s prediction that a “rank-order” manipulation changes what options the participants select and how strongly they prefer the options. We also find extreme evidence in favor of a contextualization effect, implying that people value formally identical gambles differently depending on whether they cue a real-life setting or not. Although we encourage replication by independent laboratories, these results suggest that the DbS is falsified for this binary choice task.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper introduces source theory, a new theory for decision under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). It shows how Savage’s subjective probabilities, with source-dependent nonlinear weighting functions, can model Ellsberg’s ambiguity. It can do so in Savage’s framework of state-contingent assets, permits nonexpected utility for risk, and avoids multistage complications. It is tractable, shows ambiguity attitudes through simple graphs, is empirically realistic, and can be used prescriptively. We provide a new tool to analyze weighting functions: pmatchers. They give Arrow–Pratt-like transformations but operate “within” rather than “outside” functions. We further show that ambiguity perception and inverse S probability weighting, seemingly unrelated concepts, are two sides of the same “insensitivity” coin.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Evasive responses enable managers to escape difficult questions in earnings calls without lying. Although such tactics are common in corporate communication and other important settings, we still know little about how investors and other listeners can avoid being misled by them. Drawing on theories from multiple disciplines, I predict that a common type of nonanswer leads to equivocal interpretations, whereas artful dodges escape detection in earnings calls. However, when investors adopt a suspicious state of mind—characterized by suspended judgment, balanced information search, and consideration of plausible rival possibilities—they are better able to distinguish potentially deceptive evasive tactics from proper responses. My experimental results support these predictions, showing that suspicious thinking allows investors to overcome nonanswers and dodges without punishing adequate responses. I also provide evidence that nonanswers and dodges are unique evasive strategies and that simple interventions aligned with the context of earnings calls can prompt suspicion. These findings contribute to research on the informational role of earnings calls and offer new insights into how suspicion influences deception judgments and into previous research on evasive responses in earnings calls.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">People are often unaware that their personal data can serve as valuable inputs for economic activities in secondary data markets. However, whether secondary monetization of personal data determines privacy preferences remains unclear. I examine whether privacy decisions are motivated by the data recipient’s ability to benefit from trading individuals’ data with a third party. A large online laboratory experiment involving personally identifiable psychometric data is implemented with real data-sharing consequences and monetary benefits. I find that individuals decrease their willingness to share data—both in terms of their likelihood of participating in the data market and the prices demanded for such participation—when the recipient’s ability to monetize the data through secondary trade is salient. Strategic responses to updated beliefs about the recipient’s gain from the trade are ruled out via the chosen price elicitation. I find that increased data exposure (to more recipients) does not explain the significant revealed disutility from secondary monetization. These findings are also robust to controlling for the risk exposure differences between data recipients and third parties. This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We study the effect of on-the-job experience on base-rate neglect, which is a common bias in assessing conditional probabilities. We do so by carrying out experiments with medical professionals, who are routinely exposed to conditional-probability problems in the form of diagnostic tests, and nonmedical professionals, who are not. As such, medical workers with more years of experience will have had more exposure to base-rate type problems than nonmedical workers with similar years of experience. We estimate the effect of on-the-job experience by comparing the answers of more or less experienced professionals in both the medical and nonmedical domains. Although the incidence of the bias is high for both groups and all levels of experience, we find that more experienced medical workers (a) have lower rates of perfect base-rate neglect (i.e., completely ignoring the base rates), (b) provide more accurate posterior estimates, and (c) adjust their estimates more in response to changes in the base rates. We observe no such difference for nonmedical workers. We conduct a number of robustness checks and consider possible mechanisms, such as education, job or survey attrition, selectivity into medical professions, and experience with false positives. Our results suggests that on-the-job experience mitigates, but does not eliminate, base-rate neglect. This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We present an experimental study of investors’ willingness to pay for socially responsible assets. In our initial public offering experiment, various assets share identical financial risk-return profiles but differ in the intensity and timing of societal benefits, represented by charitable donations. We find that subjects value societal benefits positively and prefer a positive correlation between financial returns and these societal benefits. We offer implications for the design of corporate social responsibility policies and for the pricing of responsible assets. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT It is increasingly recognized that new information is filtered through the lens of prior experience. Research has shown descriptive probability information (“description”) often does not impact decisions for people who have previously observed a sample of outcomes related to the choice (“experience”). However, the effect of description on mental representations of risk probability in the presence of experience has rarely been examined. In two experiments, participants ( n = 263 college students and n = 1032 MTurk workers) played a game that exposed them to a predetermined rate of wins and losses, after which some participants received information about the game&#39;s expected rate of losses. Description strongly impacted participants&#39; verbatim estimates of the risk of losing the game. However, description had little or no detectable impact on participants&#39; gist risk estimates. Further analysis showed that lower gist risk estimates were associated with later decisions to continue playing the game. Verbatim risk estimates were correlated with later decisions, but no effect was observed while controlling for the effects of gist on decisions. This research additionally tested two approaches to strengthening the effect of description on gist, finding a small effect of one approach but not the other. Results suggest that descriptive information materials delivered after experience may be less likely to alter future decisions if the information does not alter gist representations of risk.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT People usually use either alternative‐based or attribute‐based decision strategies to make intertemporal choices. While it is appealing to infer such decision strategies from information search patterns, whether the latter can always reflect the former remains unclear. This research examined the potential correspondence between information search patterns and decision strategies in intertemporal choices under three decision conditions. Two of the conditions involved explicit instructions on whether an alternative‐based or an attribute‐based strategy should be implemented, whereas under the third, free condition, participants were asked to choose solely according to their true preferences. For each condition, alternative‐ and attribute‐based information search patterns were identified based on the numbers of alternative‐based and attribute‐based transitions in eye movements. For the free condition, decision strategies were inferred by comparing the fitting performance of relevant dynamic models. A clear correspondence was found between information search patterns and decision strategies under the instructed conditions, but this correspondence was apparently lacking in the free condition. These results call into question the general practice of inferring decision strategies from process tracing data. Potential reasons for the revealed dissociation and further research to improve understanding of the correspondence between information search patterns and decision strategies are discussed.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">ABSTRACT Cooperation and trust are critical parts of many relationships. However, such relationships are often studied in siloed ways, leading to incomplete explanations of behavior (e.g., from the point of view of a buyer or a seller, but not necessarily both). This paper makes three contributions to broadening this perspective. First, the authors develop a model incorporating individual differences (genetics), environmental (interpersonal touch), and psychological (empathy and trust) elements to shed light on when and how cooperation is influenced in dyadic relationships. Empathy was predicted to be elicited by the interaction of human touch and the COMT gene to induce, in turn, felt trust and cooperative behaviors. Second, the centipede game is used as a behaviorally relevant context to study how and under what conditions players cooperate while competing with each other. The results of a conditional serial mediation demonstrate that cooperative responses are guided by the interaction of touch and the COMT gene, where empathy and trust are mediators. Actual actions of players are recorded and real behaviors explained. In an additional registered experiment, the mediator, empathy, was manipulated to show that it had a positive effect on trust.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The Author(s)Value-based decisions often require retrieving previous experiences from memory. A sense of familiarity, the subjective feeling of having encountered an option before, guides these search and decision processes. The current work explores the scope and boundaries of familiarity-based retrieval in predicting value-based decisions. To reach this goal, we formulate a familiarity-based decision making model (FB-DMM) that relies upon global matching of the current options to previously seen choice options within the current context. FB-DMM predicts that people prefer frequently encountered options to less frequent ones and explains why familiarity elicits preferences for high-value rather than low-value options. In Experiment 1, FB-DMM predicted participants&#39; choices well when participants chose between option pairs with the same frequency of encounters, but different values. Against FB-DMM&#39;s prediction, participants rejected frequently repeated options with low values, indicating that individuals may have recollected the options&#39; values instead. Experiment 2 aimed to diminish recollection-based processing by restricting decision times. Imposing time pressure reduced accuracy of participants&#39; choices and slightly reduced decisions against familiar options with low values. A comparison of FB-DMM to a recollection-based model indicated that participants engaged less in recollection-based retrieval under time pressure. Taken together, our results suggest that familiarity-based matching processes capture a wider range of decision phenomena than suggested initially. Still, FB-DMM needs to be complemented by recollection-based processes to explain decisions going beyond the familiarity principle.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025People have been shown to be effective causal reasoners. Yet, they also commit systematic errors. A model referred to as the mutation sampler explains this dual pattern of results by positing that causal inferences arise from a rational process, that is, an algorithm that is able to compute normatively correct answers but sometimes falls short due to cognitive resource limitations. To date, tests of this account has been limited to binary variables and usually generative causal relations, relations in which a cause makes its effect more probable. This study conducts new empirical tests of how people draw causal inferences with continuous variables that form a common cause network that are related by a mixture of generative and inhibitory relations (a cause lowers the value of its effects). The results showed that people commit the same qualitative errors with continuous variables that they do with binary ones and, moreover, that these effects are explained by a new version of the mutation sampler developed for continuous variables. Additional analyses indicate that the sampling process that the mutation sampler posits had a quantitative effect on all of participants’ causal inferences, not just those that exhibit qualitative violations of normative reasoning.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsPeople&#39;s probability judgments often appear to be probabilistically incoherent, as exemplified by the conjunction fallacy. Recently, various sampling-based models have been proposed as an integrative account for different biases and fallacies in probability judgments. In the current study, the novel Event Ranking Task was used to investigate sampling-based models of probability judgments. On each trial of the Event Ranking Task, participants were asked to provide a ranking for an event set consisting of four events, A, not-A, B, and not-B, in terms of their perceived likelihoods. Qualitative predictions were formally derived by assuming direct sampling from a fixed underlying probability distribution. Adding read-out noise in the sampling process – as suggested in the Probability Theory plus Noise model (Costello and Watts, 2014) – did not change the qualitative predictions. Two online experiments, where participants ranked twelve different event sets, yielded results in line with the qualitative predictions, providing evidence for the idea that mental sampling underlies probability judgments.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 Elsevier B.V.Decision confidence is regarded as a driving force behind information seeking, i.e. sampling more evidence before committing to a choice. Here, in two pre-registered experiments we assessed how two causal manipulations of confidence affect information seeking. During the training phase of a perceptual discrimination task, we used a comparative feedback manipulation (Experiment 1) or a difficulty manipulation (Experiment 2) to induce under- and overconfidence. In a subsequent testing phase, participants rated their confidence in each decision, after which they could choose to see the stimulus again before indicating their final choice and confidence. Our results demonstrate a striking dissociation between the type of manipulation used and the effect on information seeking. When under−/overconfidence was induced via comparative feedback (Exp.1), the tendency to seek information was decreased or increased, respectively, and this effect was fully mediated by trial-level confidence. Strikingly, when under−/overconfidence was induced via the difficulty manipulation (Exp.2), participants still used trial-level confidence to steer information seeking, yet overall sought less information in the condition associated with task-level underconfidence. This effect of training difficulty was unmediated by confidence. We discuss our findings in light of differences in task difficulty when transitioning from training to test phase between experiments. Our results demonstrate that the link between confidence and information seeking is not as simple as previously assumed and suggest that confidence and information seeking are separately driven by beliefs about past performance versus perceived difficulty.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The AuthorsPeople often forgo their own self-interest to react to fairness and justice violations, even when not directly affected by the infraction. There are different ways to react to an injustice: some may prefer to punish the perpetrator, and others to compensate the victim. Here, our focus is on the role played by attention to determine these choices, investigating the relationship between attentional mechanisms and punishment/compensation in five preregistered experiments (N = 1157). Two eye-tracking experiments showed that people who focus more on the offender&#39;s payoff are more likely to punish, and when an exogenous stimulation increases the focus on the offender&#39;s payoff, people spend more to punish. An offender bias was also found, meaning that people, overall, prefer to focus on the offender&#39;s, rather than the victim&#39;s, payoff, and punish more than compensate. This was confirmed in three behavioural experiments, where people were exposed to either the offender&#39;s or the victim&#39;s payoff: when given the choice, people prefer to reveal the offender&#39;s payoff, and then punish; however, when randomly exposed to the victim&#39;s payoff, the preference for punishment disappears. Affective empathy boosts this effect: higher empathy leads to more punishment (or compensation) when the offender&#39;s (or victim&#39;s) payoff is revealed. These findings suggest that, whilst people have an intrinsic motivation to search for information that matches their preference (i.e., the offender&#39;s payoff and punishment), when exposed to an alternative piece of information (i.e., the victim&#39;s payoff), they modify their behaviour. Implications for understanding information bubbles and ways to overcome them are discussed.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Humans exhibit a striking tendency to persist with chosen goals. This strong attachment to goals can often appear irrational - a perspective captured by terms such as perseverance or sunk-cost biases. In this review, we explore how goal commitment could stem from several adaptive mechanisms, including those that optimise cognitive resources, shield decisions from interference, and scaffold motivation in the absence of accessible reward signals. We propose that these computational considerations have important implications for algorithmic architectures supporting decision making, including separate algorithms for goal selection and implementation, and for monitoring ongoing goals versus alternative sources of reward. Finally, we discuss how a variety of mechanisms supporting goal commitment and abandonment could relate to dimensions affected in mental health.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract Human planning tends to be efficient, focusing on a relatively small number of options when considering future paths. Recent proposals have suggested that this efficiency reflects intelligent deployment of the limited resources available for planning. A prediction of this and related proposals is that when individuals spend time thinking should depend on the benefits and costs of additional computation. We tested this hypothesis by measuring how much time humans spent thinking before acting in over 12 million online chess games. Players spent more time thinking in board positions where additional computation was more beneficial. This relationship was greater in stronger players, and was strengthened by considering only the information available to the player at the time of choice. A simple model based on measuring the actual cost of spending time thinking in online chess was able to capture qualitative features of this relationship. These results provide evidence that the amount of time humans spend thinking is appropriately sensitive to the value of computation.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">© 2025 The Author(s)As foreign language use becomes more commonplace in the globalized market, we ask whether using a foreign language systematically impacts financial decisions. We conducted a lab experiment in Beijing, China, with 357 native Mandarin Chinese speakers who know English as a foreign language. We ran a series of sealed-bid, common value auctions, where winning bidders often pay more than the object is worth and hence suffer from the “winner&#39;s curse.” Here we show that using a foreign language reduces the winner&#39;s curse, as winning bidders were less likely to overbid for the object. When using a native tongue, bidders adopted a naïve strategy, while with a foreign language they got closer to the Nash equilibrium bid. However, as bidders received feedback on others’ bidding behavior across consecutive auctions, bidding across the language treatments converged to the naïve bid. These results suggest that the language through which individuals make bidding decisions can have influential effects on financial decision making in market settings.</span>
