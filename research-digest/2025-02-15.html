                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract A common assumption of models of decision making under risk is that people choose the level of risk they deem optimal for themselves. We, however, provide novel evidence that people systematically choose risk levels that they report as unsatisfactory. Data from three surveys show that around 50 percent of participants report dissatisfaction with the level of risk they take in life overall, and that a large majority of participants are dissatisfied with their risk taking in at least some subdomain of life. Significantly, for most (although not all) domains, far more of those who express dissatisfaction with their risk taking believe they take insufficient as opposed to excessive risks. Probing mechanisms, we find that internal factors (e.g., emotions) are more important determinants of unsatisfactory risk taking than external factors (e.g., constraints). Our findings suggest that choices under risk, like choices across time, may be explained by dual process theories that incorporate both deliberation and emotions. We also find a strong negative correlation between dissatisfaction with risk taking and life satisfaction. While our data do not enable us to establish causality, this finding provides suggestive evidence that dissatisfaction with risk taking may be consequential for subjective well-being.</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Do people change their preferences when they are offered the same risky lotteries at different times (now vs. the future)? Construal level theory (CLT) suggests that people do because our mental representation of events is moderated by how near or distant such events are in time. According to CLT, in the domain of risk preferences, psychological distance causes payoffs and probabilities to be differentially weighted or attended between present and future timepoints: Temporal distance increases the influence of payoffs and decreases the influence of probabilities. Specifically, CLT predicts that high probability/low amount lotteries (i.e., %-lotteries) are preferred in the present, whereas low probability/high amount lotteries (i.e., $-lotteries) are preferred in the future, even when the expected value of these lotteries is identical. We present a functional characterization and systematic investigation of this putative pattern of risk preferences and develop a formal model that incorporates CLT&#39;s predictions. In five experiments, we examined several factors that could moderate the effect (e.g., outcome and probability magnitude, lottery presentation format, incentivization procedures). Both our behavioral observations and modeling results suggest the effect is labile, and if it does occur, it is not fully consistent with our formal model of CLT.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Psychologists have long been intrigued by decision-induced changes in preferences where making a decision strengthens one&#39;s relative preference between more and less preferred options. This phenomenon has been explained through two prominent theories: a dissonance account, which suggests that it results from the decision maker&#39;s attempt to minimize an unpleasant emotional-motivational state of &quot;dissonance,&quot; and an inference account, which posits that it reflects a process of inferring and updating one&#39;s &quot;true&quot; preferences. In the current research, we investigate whether, how, and why framing a decision as a choice or a rejection influences decision-induced preference modulation. Across 13 preregistered experiments, including seven ( N = 6,248 participants from North America and Asia) reported in the main text, we find that reject-framed decisions between attractive options induce greater postdecision preference modulation (i.e., a larger preference gap between options) than choose-framed decisions, all else equal. Supporting the inference account, the effect is moderated by attribute similarity and choice set valence while being mediated consistently by perceived action diagnosticity. In contrast, purported moderators and process measures of the dissonance account received no support when tested. Additionally, we systematically address potential confounds associated with varying levels of &quot;noise&quot; in preference expression through decisions, an issue that had encumbered previous paradigms on preference modulation. Our findings suggest that changes in preference induced by ordinary day-to-day decisions primarily stem from an ongoing process of information inference and updating rather than dissonance reduction. This research also provides insights into the previously unforeseen consequences of framing interventions in policy and business. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Traditional explanations for stereotypes assume that they result from deficits in humans (ingroup-favoring motives, cognitive biases) or their environments (majority advantages, real group differences). An alternative explanation recently proposed that stereotypes can emerge when exploration is costly. Even optimal decision makers in an ideal environment can inadvertently form incorrect impressions from arbitrary encounters. However, all these existing theories essentially describe shortcuts that fail to explain the multidimensionality of stereotypes. Stereotypes of social groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, organized along dimensions of warmth and competence. We show that these dimensions and the associated stereotypes can result from feature-based exploration: When individuals make self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an environment where exploring new options carries an implicit cost and when these options share similar attributes, they are more likely to separate groups along multiple dimensions. We formalize this theory via the contextual multiarmed bandit problem, use the resulting model to generate testable predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human behavior. We evaluate this process in incentivized decisions involving as many as 20 real jobs and successfully recover the classic dimensions of warmth and competence. Further experiments show that intervening on the cost of exploration effectively mitigates bias, further demonstrating that exploration cost per se is the operating variable. Future diversity interventions may consider how to reduce exploration cost, in ways that parallel our manipulations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).</span>

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Researchers have long debated how humans select relevant objects amid physically salient distractions. An increasingly popular view holds that the key to avoiding distractions lies in suppressing the attentional priority of a salient distractor. However, the precise mechanisms of distractor suppression remain elusive. Because the computation of attentional priority is a time-dependent process, distractor suppression must be understood within these temporal dynamics. In four experiments, we tracked the temporal dynamics of visual attention using a novel forced-response method, by which participants were required to express their latent attentional priority at varying processing times via saccades. We show that attention could be biased either toward or away from a salient distractor depending on the timing of observation, with these temporal dynamics varying substantially across experiments. These dynamics were explained by a computational model assuming the distractor and target priority signals arrive asynchronously in time and with different influences on saccadic behavior. The model suggests that distractor signal suppression can be achieved via a &quot;slow&quot; mechanism in which the distractor priority signal dictates saccadic behavior until a late-arriving priority signal overrides it, or a &quot;fast&quot; mechanism which directly suppresses the distractor priority signal&#39;s behavioral expression. The two mechanisms are temporally dissociable and can work collaboratively, resulting in time-dependent patterns of attentional allocation. The current work underscores the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of visual attention and provides a computational architecture for understanding the mechanisms of distractor suppression.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">This paper investigates whether limited liability and moral hazard affect risk taking through motivated beliefs. On the one hand, limited liability encourages investors to take excessive risks. On the other, excessive risk taking makes it hard for investors to maintain a positive self-image when moral hazard is present. Using a novel experimental design, we show that subjects form motivated beliefs to self-justify their excessive risk taking. For the same investment opportunity, subjects invest more and are significantly more optimistic about the success of the investment if its failure can harm others. We show that more than one third of the investment increases under limited liability, and moral hazard can be explained through motivated beliefs. Moreover, through a treatment with limited liability but no moral hazard, we show that motivated beliefs are formed subconsciously and can lead to the paradoxical result of investors taking larger risks when their investment can harm a third party compared with when it cannot. These results underscore the importance of motivated beliefs in regulatory policy, emphasizing that policymakers must not only address bad incentives, but also address the role of bad beliefs.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We examine a beauty contest game with an option to analyze an additional disclosure. We analytically prove that in some scenarios, coordination incentives cause sophisticated players who can comprehend disclosures to choose not to analyze them to match unsophisticated players’ actions, a phenomenon we call “coordinated inattention.” Laboratory experiments provide support for the coordinated inattention mechanism: Coordination incentives reduce sophisticated subjects’ propensity to analyze disclosures, especially when they believe others are unlikely to comprehend them. We further find that psychological biases help reduce coordinated inattention. Subjects are overconfident, sophisticated subjects overestimate others’ ability to comprehend disclosures, and both biases are associated with a higher tendency to analyze disclosures. Our analysis suggests that unsophisticated decision makers’ inability to comprehend complex disclosures has a negative spillover effect by reducing sophisticated decision makers’ attention to disclosures. Our results highlight the importance of the recent efforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to make disclosures easier to comprehend.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Rapid technological developments in online markets fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and sellers. Online platforms can easily gather data about consumers’ search behavior, allowing for price discrimination. Therefore, product search becomes a strategic choice. Consumers face a tradeoff: Search intensely and receive a better fit at a potentially higher price or restrict search behavior, be strategically inattentive, and receive a worse fit but maybe a better deal. We study the resulting strategic buyer-seller interaction theoretically and experimentally. Our experimental results shed a critical light on the added value for consumers through the rise of online platforms and on the effectiveness of current regulations.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">We investigate a bargaining setting between an “informed” player, who has private information, and an “uninformed” player. The informed player has the option to truthfully disclose private information in two unique environments. In the first environment, the informed player is randomly matched with an uninformed player and, after matching, can voluntarily disclose private information prior to a negotiation taking place. In the second environment, the informed player can voluntarily disclose private information before any endogenous matching between players (and subsequent negotiation) takes place. We begin by examining these environments theoretically. When disclosure occurs after matching, we show that low informed types should disclose more often than high informed types to avoid disagreement. However, when disclosure occurs before matching, for a range of parameter values, we show that high informed types should disclose more than low informed types to secure a better match. We test these predictions in a controlled human-subjects experiment and verify many of the theoretical predictions. Among other results, we find that low informed types do indeed disclose their private information to avoid disagreement and that, when it is in their interest to do so, high informed types disclose their private information to secure a better match. Another key insight is that high uninformed types benefit from disclosure regardless of whether it occurs before or after matching.

Although greater availability of information can be beneficial, it may also exacerbate retail investors’ existing trading deficiencies. Exploiting the sudden shutdown of Yahoo! Finance API, the largest free API for retail investors, this study examines how access to tech-enabled raw financial data affects retail investment. We find that retail trading volumes in stocks favored by active retail investors dropped by 8.6%–10.5% within one month of the API shutdown. The remaining retail trades collectively became more predictive of future returns, suggesting less gambling-like behavior after the API shutdown. Moreover, our randomized controlled experiment affirms the underlying mechanism: tech-enabled access to high-volume historical price data increases individuals’ overconfidence, which further leads them to engage in excessive trading. The study reveals an unintended consequence of technology-led, wider data access for retail investors. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Standard search models assume that consumers actively decide on the order, identity, and number of products they search. We document that online, a large fraction of searches happen in a more passive manner, with consumers merely reacting to online advertisements that do not allow them to choose the timing or the identity of products to which they will be exposed. Using a clickstream panel data set capturing full URL addresses of websites that consumers visit, we show how to detect whether a click is ad initiated. We then report that in the apparel category, ad-initiated clicks account for more than half of all website arrivals, are more concentrated early on in the consumer search process, and lead to less in-depth searches and fewer transactions, consistent with the passive nature of these searches. To account for these systematic differences between active and passive searches, we propose and estimate a simple model that accommodates both types of searches. Our results show that incorrectly treating all searches as active inflates the estimated value of brands that advertise frequently. Our model can more accurately recover data patterns, especially for advertising brands. We finish with model extensions and a discussion of the managerial implications.

                  <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                  <span style="color:#374151;">Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are an important class of cognitive models used to analyze both response time and response choice data recorded from decision-making tasks. Developments in estimation procedures have helped EAMs become important both in basic scientific applications and solution-focused applied work. Hierarchical Bayesian estimation frameworks for the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model and the diffusion decision model (DDM) have been widely used, but still suffer from some key limitations, particularly for large sample sizes, for models with many parameters, and when linking decision-relevant covariates to model parameters. We extend upon previous work with methods for estimating the LBA and DDM in hierarchical Bayesian frameworks that include random effects that are correlated between people and include regression-model links between decision-relevant covariates and model parameters. Our methods work equally well in cases where the covariates are measured once per person (e.g., personality traits or psychological tests) or once per decision (e.g., neural or physiological data). We provide methods for exact Bayesian inference, using particle-based Markov chain Monte-Carlo, and also approximate methods based on variational Bayesian (VB) inference. The VB methods are sufficiently fast and efficient that they can address large-scale estimation problems, such as with very large data sets. We evaluate the performance of these methods in applications to data from three existing experiments. Detailed algorithmic implementations and code are freely available for all methods.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Using Bayesian methods to apply computational models of cognitive processes, or Bayesian cognitive modeling , is an important new trend in psychological research. The rise of Bayesian cognitive modeling has been accelerated by the introduction of software that efficiently automates the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling used for Bayesian model fitting-including the popular Stan and PyMC packages, which automate the dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and No-U-Turn Sampler (HMC/NUTS) algorithms that we spotlight here. Unfortunately, Bayesian cognitive models can struggle to pass the growing number of diagnostic checks required of Bayesian models. If any failures are left undetected, inferences about cognition based on the model&#39;s output may be biased or incorrect. As such, Bayesian cognitive models almost always require troubleshooting before being used for inference. Here, we present a deep treatment of the diagnostic checks and procedures that are critical for effective troubleshooting, but are often left underspecified by tutorial papers. After a conceptual introduction to Bayesian cognitive modeling and HMC/NUTS sampling, we outline the diagnostic metrics, procedures, and plots necessary to detect problems in model output with an emphasis on how these requirements have recently been changed and extended. Throughout, we explain how uncovering the exact nature of the problem is often the key to identifying solutions. We also demonstrate the troubleshooting process for an example hierarchical Bayesian model of reinforcement learning, including supplementary code. With this comprehensive guide to techniques for detecting, identifying, and overcoming problems in fitting Bayesian cognitive models, psychologists across subfields can more confidently build and use Bayesian cognitive models in their research.

We develop a simultaneous-search framework that rationalizes this practice. In this framework, the admissions process is correlated across schools so that if an applicant is rejected by one school, she is more likely to be rejected by more selective schools. We find that an applicant then optimally targets both safeties and reaches. We characterize how the optimal portfolio varies with the applicant’s beliefs, risk attitudes, and application costs and offer an algorithm that delivers the optimal portfolio in polynomial time.

We propose a signaling model in which wives try to maintain a good reputation in the eyes of their husbands to receive high transfers. This leads them to (i) avoid risky purchases (goods with unknown returns) and (ii) knowingly overuse low-return goods to hide bad purchase decisions—we call this the intrahousehold sunk cost effect.

                  <span style="color:#374151;">Abstract A crucial aspect of self‐control is the voluntary inhibition of impulsive actions. Stimuli can elicit impulses (or preparation) to act not only in the presence but also in the absence of perceptual awareness, but whether people control action impulses elicited by unconscious stimuli remains unclear. This study used a masked prime version of the Go/NoGo/Free task and combined mathematical modeling of behavioral data to investigate whether people control the unconscious action impulses. In the experiment, when the subliminal prime stimulus triggers the unconscious action impulse, participants need to freely decide whether or not to perform the action. The results showed that the no‐response rate was higher in Go‐prime free‐choice trials than in NoGo‐prime free‐choice trials, and there were marginally larger negative drift rates in the former than in the latter. The results suggest that people are more likely to make inhibitory decisions about unconscious action impulses. This finding provides support for a framework that extends the feedback loop model of intentional inhibition.</span>
